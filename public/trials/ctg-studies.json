Early detection and treatment of cervical lesions and standardized management have emerged as essential pillars in the Global Cervical Cancer Elimination. The loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is widely employed as a preferred approach for the diagnosis and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions and early invasive cervical cancer. Patients with high-grade cervical lesions are more prone to experiencing sexual dysfunction and psychological disorders after LEEP, attributed to the unique surgical site, physiological alterations, and psychological stress during the postoperative recovery process, thereby adversely affecting their quality of life. Currently, there is a shortage of research evidence regarding targeted intervention measures and long-term effect evaluations for sexual function quality and quality of life after LEEP for cervical lesions. In recent years, the health management model based on patient navigation has evolved into a novel modality for facilitating comprehensive tumor prevention and control. However, its effect in managing cervical lesions has yet to be comprehensively assessed. Therefore, we will design a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a patient navigation-based health management model on quality of life and sexual function after LEEP in patients with cervical lesions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasias"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":128,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Patient navigation-based health management"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"25 Years","maximumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Peking University People's Hospital","city":"Beijing","state":"Beijing","zip":"100044","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Wenhui Ren, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"86+18800124938","email":"rwh0617@outlook.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]}}},

For many pediatric solid tumors, complete resection of the primary site and/or metastatic deposits is critical for achieving a cure. An optimal intra-operative tool to help visualize tumor and its margins would be of benefit. ICG real-time fluorescence imaging is a technique being used increasingly in adults for this purpose. We propose to use it during surgery for pediatric malignancies. All patients with tumors that require localization for resection or biopsy of the tumor and/or metastatic lesions will be eligible.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nTo assess the feasibility of Indocyanine Green (ICG)-mediated near-infrared (NIR) imagery to identify neoplastic disease during the conduct of surgery to resect neoplastic lesions in children and adolescents. NIR imaging will be done at the start of surgery to assess NIR-positivity of the lesion(s) and at the end of surgery to assess completeness of resection. Separate assessments will be made for the following different histologic categories:\n\n1. Osteosarcoma\n2. Ewing Sarcoma\n3. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)\n4. Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma (NRSTS)\n5. Neuroblastoma\n6. Renal tumors (Only bilateral Wilms Tumor patients will be included.)\n7. Metastatic pulmonary deposits\n8. Liver tumors, lymphoma, other rare tumors, and nodules of unknown etiology\n\nExploratory Objectives\n\n1. To compare the ICG uptake by primary vs metastatic site and pre-treated (chemotherapy, radiation, or both) vs non-pre-treated.\n2. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery to find additional lesions not identified by standard of care intraoperative inspection and tactile feedback.\n3. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery to find additional lesions not identified on preoperative diagnostic imaging.\n4. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of NIR imagery for identifying residual disease at the conclusion of a tumor resection."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neoplastic Disease","Solid Tumor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":312,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Indocyanine Green"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Memphis","state":"Tennessee","zip":"38105","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Abdelhafeez Abdelhafeez, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"866-278-5833","email":"referralinfo@stjude.org"},{"name":"Abdelhafeez Abdelhafeez, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":35.14953,"lon":-90.04898}}]}}},

The investigators will randomly assign 600 premenopausal female patients with operable breast cancer to receive four cycles of docetaxel and epirubicin (TE); or four cycles of docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TEC). After every two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the investigators will estimate the effectiveness of therapy. Patients will undergo modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery after four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and then receive postoperative chemotherapy (two cycles), radiation therapy, herceptin targeted therapy or hormone therapy according to the NCCN (2011) guideline. The follow-up will be ten years after surgeries. The primary aim is to examine whether the docetaxel and epirubicin (TE) will be as effective as the docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TEC) (pCR rate, cCR rate, PR rate, SD rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)).

Standard therapy for malignant tumor includes surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Despite optimal treatment the prognosis remains poor. There is an urgent need for more effective therapies. The Warburg effect has been widely observed in human cancers. The main energy supply of tumor cells are aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, they are highly dependent on glucose metabolism. Recently, some scholars have suggested that 'Restricted calorie Ketogenic Diet (RKD)' might be able to inhibit glycolysis and thus anti-tumor by restricting carbohydrate intake. This will 'starve' cancer cells, which will lead to cell death. There are many animal and in vitro studies shown that RKD can reduce the tumor size and thus tumor cell growth of malignant tumors.

However, the production of 18F requires accelerators and is associated with relatively high diagnostic costs, which to some extent limits its widespread clinical application. In comparison to Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) devices are more abundant and offer lower diagnostic expenses. With the utilization of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) crystals in SPECT and advancements in image reconstruction techniques, the resolution and sensitivity of SPECT is continually improving. Therefore, the development of a simplified and cost-effective novel SPECT tumor imaging agent holds significant practical significance. This study involved the design and synthesis of a glucose-derived ligand with a linker containing seven methylene units and an isonitrile group (CN7DG). The CN7DG ligand was labeled with 99mTc to prepare a more lipophilic 99mTc-CN7DG complex, aiming to investigate a novel SPECT imaging agent for tumor imaging."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Malignant Tumor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"99mTc-CNDG SPECT/CT"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Beijing","state":"Beijing","zip":"100730","country":"China","contacts":[{"name":"Hongli Jing","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+86-18600586399","email":"annsmile1976@sina.com"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.9075,"lon":116.39723}}]}}},

It works by using high-intensity ultrasound waves to create microscopic bubbles within the tumour tissue. These bubbles rapidly expand and collapse, generating shock waves that disrupt the tissue. The technique is highly precise and can be targeted to specific areas of the liver, allowing for selective destruction of tumour cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. This study will enrol 20 patients with liver tumours (be it primary or secondary liver tumours), monitor their post-operative adverse events, and study the changes in tumour size and volume after treatment. Histotripsy will be performed under general anaesthesia, with real-time monitoring by ultrasound, and deliver high-intensity ultrasound waves in single session or multiple sessions. Similar to other minimal invasive treatments, patients will be admitted 1 day prior, then receive Histotripsy on the next day and stay overnight for observation. Patients will be discharged on the 3rd day if unremarkable. During the hospital stay, blood samplings will be taken for evaluation around 2-4 times in total depending on the length of hospital stay."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Liver Tumour"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Histotripsy"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"The University of Hong Kong","city":"Hong Kong","zip":"0000","country":"Hong Kong","contacts":[{"name":"Albert Chan, MS","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+85222553025","email":"acchan@hku.hk"},{"name":"Albert Chan, MS","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Vince Lau, MBBS","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Kyongtae Bae, PhD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Chi Leung Chiang, MBChB","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Rina Hui, MBBS","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":22.27832,"lon":114.17469}}]}}},

Shoulder pain is a common complaint from patients who have had abdominal surgery and the pain is thought to be related to the use of IP.\n\nIn addition to anesthesia (which keeps you asleep during surgery), the current standard practice is to block the nerve-muscle junction with a type of drug called neuromuscular blockade (NMB) which paralyzes the abdominal muscles. This means that a lower level of insufflation pressure is needed by the surgeon.\n\nTo reverse the effects of NMB after surgery, a drug called neostigmine is given.\n\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to compare the use of standard-of-care moderate NMB and neostigmine to the use of deep NMB and a drug called Sugammadex when given to elderly patients (patients who are 65 years of age or older) who are scheduled to have robotic abdominal surgery. \"Deep\" and \"moderate\" in this study refers to the dose or strength of the NMB given.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Sugammadex and neostigmine are FDA approved and commercially available for the reversal of NMB. It is considered investigational to compare Sugammadex and neostigmine to learn if the use of one or the other in elderly patients can reduce the level of shoulder pain after surgery.\n\nUp to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study.

Cytokinotherapy is a cost-effective, well-known available method of therapy for the patients with tumors. The objective response possibly correlates to the tumor's size, aggressiveness, age, and other primary factors. Multifactor analysis requires a large amount of data. Therefore, the investigators created the first database aimed to collect data concerning the patients with cancer and the clinical outcomes of cytokinogenetic therapy. The acquired data must be processed to detect the key factors effecting the outcomes. Cytokinotherapy is a universal therapeutic approach, although we lack information that would help to personalize it and reduce the rate of progression. The main goal is to find the relationship between initial patients' characteristics and effectiveness of cytokinotherapy for early risks detection. The predictive models that could be elaborated from the TCTD-1 analysis will complement knowledge of cytokinotherapy rationale.

Within oncology training programs, communication training is mostly unstructured observation and feedback in the clinic and many learners receive inadequate training. Currently, educational resources are limited, and residents have indicated a desire for more education on end-of-life communication skills. A formal communication curriculum could fill a gap and help to standardize teaching and evaluation.\n\nThe overall goal of this study is to establish an effective communication skills curriculum for oncology residents that can be delivered remotely and that addresses difficult conversations with cancer patients. Through this preliminary study, we will explore the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial comparing different training experiences to understand how best to help oncology residents develop strong end-of-life communication skills."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oncology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":23,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"RESTORE"},{"name":"Medical Interaction and Coaching"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Juravinski Cancer Centre - Hamilton Health Sciences","city":"Hamilton","state":"Ontario","zip":"L8V 5C2","country":"Canada","geoPoint":{"lat":43.25011,"lon":-79.84963}}]}}},

Although prevalence rates of sexual difficulties vary depending on several factors including primary diagnosis, treatment modality and methods of assessment, estimates rates are reported to range from 40% to 100%. Despite the abundant literature on sexuality and intimacy, communication about sexual health is often absent or inadequate between patients and health care providers. In this context, more research is needed to understand patients' priorities and needs for information about sexuality.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the main difficulties faced by patients in their sexual life and to evaluate patient's satisfaction after having followed sessions of psychosexual therapy proposed at Rafaël Institute, France. The survey will be conducted using questionnaires developed specifically for this study. All questions will be coded through a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Responses to each question will be analyzed with higher mean scores (\\>4) indicating main difficulties faced by patients in their sexual life.

They can continue taking regorafenib if it is working when treatment with regorafenib in their previous study ends.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to find:\n\n* How safe is the continued treatment with regorafenib in participants with solid tumors?\n* How well is the continued treatment with regorafenib tolerated by participants with solid tumors?\n\nParticipants will continue with the same dose of regorafenib that they were taking in their previous study as long as the treatment works for them/they want to continue the treatment/other medical conditions do not prevent them from participating in the study. For participants that are under 18 years of age, regorafenib tablets will be taken by mouth once daily for 2 weeks and repeat again after a 1-week gap. For participants that are over 18 years of age, regorafenib tablets will be taken by mouth once daily for 3 weeks and repeat again after a 1-week gap.\n\nAt the start of the study, researchers will review participants' records from the previous study. During the study, researchers will use blood samples and X-rays taken from participants under the age of 18 years to check how safe regorafenib is for children.

A large body of research has shown that acupuncture and other integrative oncology (IO) modalities, when provided in conjunction with supportive care, can significantly address and alleviate QoL-related concerns. In the proposed study, we examine an innovative model of IO and palliative care, provided to patients with cancer during hospitalization. Oncology patients at the Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, will be referred by hospital to IO/palliative care, specifying the patient's QoL-related concerns. After signing the informed consent form, patients will be asked to choose between IO intervention (Group A and B) or palliative nursing counseling only (Group C). Patients choosing to undergo integrative treatment will be randomly allocated to one of the two study interventions: acupressure-relaxation alone (Group A); or acupressure-relaxation modalities with acupuncture (Group B). The response to the study intervention for QoL-related concerns will be re-assessed immediately; at 24-48 hours; and after 2 weeks following the treatment. Patients will also undergo objective measurements during treatment using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Nociception Levels (NOL) to determine the impact of the intervention on their QoL and concerns. In summary, the proposed study will examine the short-term impact of an integrative/palliative intervention on patient QoL-related concerns, comparing acupressure-relaxation modalities with or without acupuncture, as well as to patients receiving palliative nursing counseling. Following discharge, treatments will be provided at one of six participating community IO services, over a 12-week period, in coordination with the oncology and palliative care teams in the community."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oncology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":520,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"acupressure/relaxation with acupuncture"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Carmel Medical center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Haifa","zip":"35152","country":"Israel","contacts":[{"name":"Eran Ben-Arye, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"972528709282","phoneExt":"0","email":"eranbe@clalit.org.il"},{"name":"Eran Ben-Arye","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":32.81841,"lon":34.9885}}]}}},

The last two decades have been marked by the application to use in the diagnosis of NETs of 3 newly available diagnostic techniques: endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), multidetector CT (MDCT), and more recently, positron emission tomography using 68Ga-labelled octreotide analogues (PET). In a prospective study conducted at a single referral centre that compared PET with conventional somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and MDCT in diagnosis, staging and follow-up of patients affected by NET, PET detected more primary and secondary lesions than other methods. Recent studies investigated the clinical impact of PET in the management of patients affected by NET, previously studied by MDCT. The investigators recently reported the results of the investigation of 19 patients suspected of having primary pancreatic NET and studied by PET, MDCT and EUS. The investigators preliminary data suggest that PET may be slightly more sensitive than MDCT in detecting small (\\<2cm) pancreatic lesions; accuracy of PET and EUS is probably similar. No prospective study has yet been devoted to evaluate the accuracy of PET in the diagnosis and staging of primary duodenal-pancreatic NETs. Furthermore, the clinical impact of the adjunct of PET to the traditional protocols of diagnosis and staging of these tumours waits to be thoroughly evaluated. Thus the appropriate place of PET in the diagnostic algorithm of patients suspected of having duodenal-pancreatic NET remains undefined.\n\nThe main aim of this project is to prospectively compare the accuracy of PET and MDCT in the diagnosis and staging of patients suspected of having duodenal-pancreatic NETs. The investigators hypothesised that PET is superior to MDCT in the diagnosis of these neoplasm (the dimension of the study sample is estimated in order to detect a 10% difference). The impact of PET on management plan of affected patients will also be evaluated. As a secondary endpoint of the study, the investigators will compare EUS, PET and MDCT in the diagnosis of primary duodenal-pancreatic NET. The study is designed as a multicentre, prospective, non-randomised clinical trial. All patients will undergo MDCT, PET and EUS in this fixed order."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neuroendocrine Tumours"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":142,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Diagnostic work up"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Irene Virgolini","city":"Innsbruck","country":"Austria","geoPoint":{"lat":47.26266,"lon":11.39454}},{"facility":"Laura Scaltriti","city":"Guastalla","state":"Reggio Emilia","zip":"42100","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.91172,"lon":10.66186}},{"facility":"ASMN IRCCS Reggio Emilia","city":"Reggio Emilia","state":"RE","zip":"42100","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.69825,"lon":10.63125}},{"facility":"Enrico Papini","city":"Albano Laziale","state":"Roma","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":41.72748,"lon":12.659}},{"facility":"Nadia Cremonini","city":"Bologna","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.49381,"lon":11.33875}},{"facility":"Fernando Cirillo","city":"Cremona","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.13325,"lon":10.02129}},{"facility":"Diego Ferone","city":"Genova","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.40478,"lon":8.94438}},{"facility":"Giovanna Pepe","city":"Milano","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.46427,"lon":9.18951}},{"facility":"Rita Conigliaro","city":"Modena","zip":"41121","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.64783,"lon":10.92539}},{"facility":"Luppi Gabriele","city":"Modena","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.64783,"lon":10.92539}},{"facility":"Pellegrino Crafa","city":"Parma","zip":"43121","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":44.79935,"lon":10.32618}},{"facility":"Piero Ferolla","city":"Perugia","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":43.1122,"lon":12.38878}},{"facility":"Antonio Chella","city":"Pisa","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":43.70853,"lon":10.4036}},{"facility":"Roberto Baldelli","city":"Roma","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":41.89193,"lon":12.51133}},{"facility":"Vittoria Rufini","city":"Roma","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":41.89193,"lon":12.51133}},{"facility":"Claudio De Angelis","city":"Torino","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.07049,"lon":7.68682}},{"facility":"Marco Gallo","city":"Torino","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.07049,"lon":7.68682}},{"facility":"Paolo Limone","city":"Torino","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.07049,"lon":7.68682}},{"facility":"Franco Grimaldi","city":"Udine","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":46.0693,"lon":13.23715}},{"facility":"Massimo Falconi","city":"Verona","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.4299,"lon":10.98444}},{"facility":"Roberto Castello","city":"Verona","country":"Italy","geoPoint":{"lat":45.4299,"lon":10.98444}}]}}},
{"protocolSection":{"identificationModule":{"nctId":"NCT02086721","briefTitle":"Phase I Clinical Study Combining L19-IL2 With SABR in Patients With Oligometastatic Solid Tumor"},"statusModule":{"overallStatus":"COMPLETED"},"sponsorCollaboratorsModule":{"leadSponsor":{"name":"Maastricht Radiation Oncology"}},"descriptionModule":{"briefSummary":"The formation of metastasis is responsible for as much as 90% of cancer-associated mortality. In spite of recent advances in oncologic therapy, approximately 50 % of the lung cancer patients have already overt disseminated cancer at diagnosis. Additionally, numerous patients with locoregional disease initially treated with curative intent develop (oligo)metastases during the course of disease. In both instances, these stage IV patients are generally considered to be incurable and mostly treated palliatively.\n\nOligometastases, defined as 1-5 sites of active disease on whole body imaging, was coined to refer to isolated sites of metastasis resembling limited tumor metastatic capacity. The implication of this concept is that local cancer treatments are curative in a proportion of patients with metastases and that incorporating local therapy is a conceptually attractive approach. In several, but not all, academic centers the standard treatment of patients with oligometastases in good general health is standard chemotherapy followed by surgery or by Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) with radical dose on the macroscopic visible tumors.\n\nThe widespread introduction of SABR and of minimally invasive surgery has fuelled research in treating patients with oligometastases. Indeed, local control of metastases can be obtained in virtually all parts of the body with a low proportion of patients experiencing severe side effects. In the few prospective studies published to date, approximately 20% of patients remained free of recurrence several years after treatment when all sites of disease were targeted by radiation.\n\nAlong with standard anti-cancer therapeutic modalities like chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), immunotherapy has recently gained a lot of attention.\n\nAngiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and therefore, considerable efforts have been made to exploit this unique target for selective drug delivery. One of the appealing targets for both approaches is the splice variant of fibronectin containing extra domain B (EDB), which is abundantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells of a variety of primary tumors as well as metastases , but virtually absent in normal tissues. Recently, a human recombinant scFv fragment directed against EDB, designated L19, was developed and subsequently combined with the pro-inflammatory interleukin-2 (IL2), resulting in the immunocytokine L19-IL2. L19-IL2 delivers high doses of IL2 to the (metastatic) tumor site(s) exploiting the selective expression of EDB on newly formed blood vessels. Interleukin-2 (IL2) plays an essential role in the activation phases of both specific and natural immune responses. Even though it has no direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, it can induce tumor regression by stimulating a potent cell-mediated response. In summary, L19-IL2 is an immunocytokine which will stimulate immune response specifically in tumors with angiogenesis and tissue remodeling.\n\nRadiotherapy is a particularly interesting partner for immunotherapy, since it can be harnessed to specifically modify the immunogenicity of the primary tumors and their microenvironment, in the attempt to generate an in situ immunization of the host against a patient's own cancer. Our hypothesis is that three independent therapeutic approaches will synergize to improve dramatically survival in patients with oligometastases of solid tumors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Solid Tumour"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"L19-IL2"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"MAASTRO clinic","city":"Maastricht","state":"Limburg","zip":"6229 ET","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":50.84833,"lon":5.68889}}]}}},

As a result, new adverse effects (AEs) are observed, particularly cardiac.\n\nThese \"new\" cardiac AEs are the consequence of a significant increase in patients life expectancy (delayed AEs not previously seen) but also the use of new pharmacological classes of anticancer drugs such as kinase inhibitors. The incidence of these cardiac AEs varies according to the patient profile and the anticancer molecules used, but their impact on the morbidity and mortality of the patients is significant.\n\nIn this context, we started at the University Hospital of Caen Normandy in September 2017 a cardio-oncology program entitled \"prevention and pharmacological management of cardiac adverse effects induced by drugs used in Oncology\" (PICARO program). This program involves the pharmacology department (opening of a dedicated consultation), the cardiology department (opening of a dedicated ultrasound consultation), vascular medicine departement (opening of a dedicated consultation) and the oncology federation. This program aims to be regional in the future. We therefore propose to build a cohort backed up to the PICARO program to assess the regional impact of cardiac AEs of anticancer drugs and thus to be better able to specify the number of AEs, the incidence and regional prevalence of these drugs. .\n\nThe constitution of this cohort is only the first step towards the constitution in the near future (2 years) of an observatory and then a regional registry of cardiac AEs induced by anticancer drugs. The objectives associated with the establishment of such a registry would be to reduce the number of cardiac AEs, the hospitalizations caused by these AEs, a better information of health professionals and patients, an improvement in the screening of patients at risk, all coming back in the context of health, clinical, epidemiological and pharmacological surveillance."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cardio-oncology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"observational cohort with plasma samples"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHU Caen","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Caen","state":"Normandy","zip":"14000","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Joachim Alexandre, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+33231064670","email":"alexandre-j@chu-caen.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":49.18585,"lon":-0.35912}}]}}},

However, their use is characterized by an increase in side effects and in particular cardiovascular effects such as high blood pressure (hypertension). One of the main classes of antiangiogens used in this indication is that of monoclonal antibodies, the leader of which is bevacizumab (Avastin®, Roche, Bale, Switzerland). Bevacizumab works by inhibiting endothelial vascular growth factor-dependent neoangiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF). In the reference studies, the inhibition of VEGF, whether extracellular (monoclonal antibody directed against VEGFA) or intracellular (receptor inhibitors with tyrosine kinase activity), induces hypertension of all grades, observed in 25% to 40 % of patients including 8 to 17% of severe grades (≥ grade 3 NCI-CTCAE). In terms of pathophysiology, inhibition of VEGFA results in a decrease in the availability of nitric oxide (NO) at the endothelial level and the appearance of arteriolar rarefaction. This induces an increase in peripheral resistance responsible ultimately for an increase in blood pressure. The occurrence of hypertension induced by anti-VEGF treatment seems to be predictive of the carcinological response in certain oncological situations such as metastatic breast cancer9, glioblastoma and mRCC. Furthermore, it has also been shown that there is an early attack on the elastic conductance arteries (branches of the aorta and its main ones) characterized by an increase in their rigidity in patients exposed to a VEGF receptor inhibitor with tyrosine activity. kinase or bevacizumab. This increase, whose poor prognostic impact is known at the cardiovascular level is largely independent of the rise in blood pressure and reflects a direct toxicity of treatments at the level of the artery wall. This increase in rigidity, refused when the pressure rises, would be predictive of a low carcinological response rate at 6 months. However, these data are based on populations that are heterogeneous in terms of carcinology and the position prior to or concomitant with other antineoplastic treatments.\n\nIn this context, the evaluation of arterial stiffness in the same patient population would make it possible to better define the involvement of the conductive arteries in a clearly defined clinical situation. Joint measurements of the plasma concentration of the treatment as well as those of factors derived from the endothelium and circulating tumor markers which, to our knowledge, have never been carried out in these patients, would make it possible to better specify the mechanisms of involvement and the links between exposure, arterial toxicity and carcinologic efficacy of bevacizumab. Of course, in order to assess more precisely the inherent impact of chemotherapy on the conductance arteries, the evolution of arterial stiffness must take into account the possible effects in patients receiving, for essentially clinical and biological reasons, systemic treatment without antiangiogenic."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oncology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy based on fluoropyrimidine IV"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"CHU de ROUEN","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Rouen","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Maxime FONTANILLES","role":"CONTACT","phone":"02 32 88 56 34","email":"Maxime.Fontanilles@chu-rouen.fr"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":49.44313,"lon":1.09932}}]}}},

Its targets include multiple cell cycle regulating proteins, cytokines and growth factors. In some cancers, its overall expression level but especially its cytoplasmic expression are correlated to a higher grade and constitute a poor prognostic factor. To date, HuR's deregulation mechanisms remain poorly understood. A few experimental studies have shown the role of certain microARNS, or of post-translational modifications. In brain tumours, HuR expression, its prognostic value and its deregulation mechanisms have been little studied to date.\n\nThe first part of the project will be a monocentric retrospective study of human brain tumour samples collected during biopsies or surgical removal. We will first evaluate HuR expression in 140 brain tumors, including 40 meningiomas and 100 gliomas of increasing grade, and look for a correlation with histological grade and survival. We will then apprehend the consequences of its deregulation by analyzing different factors involved in the cell cycle and stress response markers. Finally, we will study the mechanisms of HuR deregulation by analyzing the expression level of several microRNAs (miR16, miR519) and the methylation state of HuR.\n\nThe second part of the project will focus on cell lines from human brain tumours. We will first attempt to confirm the interactions between HuR and markers involved in the cell cycle and stress response, then the regulation of HuR by its methylation and by microRNAs (miR16 and miR519). We would also like to study the consequences of HuR inhibition and overexpression on cell proliferation, under various conditions of induced stress (pharmacological agents, physical stress). Finally, we will study the consequences of an experimental vitamin B12 deficiency on HuR expression and tumor cell adaptation to stress."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Tumours"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":140,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Guillaume GAUCHOTTE","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Vandoeuvre Les Nancy","zip":"54511","country":"France","contacts":[{"name":"Guillaume GAUCHOTTE, PU-PH","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":48.65,"lon":6.18333}}]}}},

The method notably gives access to proteins, metabolites, RNA, DNA and exosomes, thus enabling holistic biomarker discovery. Owing to its non-destructive nature, EXPEL provides for the first time both clinicians and researchers with the opportunity to analyze identical material.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that the conservation liquid used to collect cells and biopsy after endoscopic ultrasound for pancreatic biopsy could contain the tissue secretome and permit a comprehensive OMICS analysis of PDAC (all stages confounded) by using a \"modified EXPEL\" procedure.

Standard treatment for patients with a T2 or T3 rectal cancer consists of preoperative short course of radiotherapy followed by surgery. In advanced cases long course of radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is used instead of a short cause. In some of these advanced cases a complete remission is observed after a long course of radio-/chemotherapy. Patients who respond well to neo-adjuvant treatment carry a better prognosis.\n\nObjective of this research is to evaluate whether neo-adjuvant chemo-/radiotherapy in small non-advanced rectal cancers can be used to obtain a complete or near complete remission. In these patients could a complete resection of the rectum as an organ be avoided by treating them with a local excision with the TEM-technique (Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery) of the scar. The advantage for these patients is, that they do not need major abdominal surgery and in a substantial number of these patients the rectum can be preserved with a better function of continence."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rectal Tumour"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Capecitabine"},{"name":"radiotherapy"},{"name":"TME resection"},{"name":"TEM surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"University Medical Centre Nijmegen","city":"Nijmegen","state":"Gelderland","zip":"6500 HB","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":51.8425,"lon":5.85278}},{"facility":"Academisch Medisch Centrum","city":"Amsterdam","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.37403,"lon":4.88969}},{"facility":"NKI AVL","city":"Amsterdam","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.37403,"lon":4.88969}},{"facility":"Slotervaart Ziekenhuis","city":"Amsterdam","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.37403,"lon":4.88969}},{"facility":"Amphia Ziekenhuis","city":"Breda","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":51.58656,"lon":4.77596}},{"facility":"IJsselland Ziekenhuis","city":"Capelle aan de IJssel","country":"Netherlands"},{"facility":"Catharina Ziekenhuis","city":"Eindhoven","zip":"5602 ZA","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":51.44083,"lon":5.47778}},{"facility":"LUMC","city":"Leiden","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.15833,"lon":4.49306}},{"facility":"MAASTRO Clinic","city":"Maastricht","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":50.84833,"lon":5.68889}},{"facility":"Laurentius Ziekenhuis","city":"Roermond","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":51.19417,"lon":5.9875}},{"facility":"Erasmus Medical Center","city":"Rotterdam","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":51.9225,"lon":4.47917}},{"facility":"Instituut Verbeeten","city":"Tilburg","zip":"5042 SB","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":51.55551,"lon":5.0913}},{"facility":"Diakonessenhuis","city":"Utrecht","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":52.09083,"lon":5.12222}}]}}},

However, metastatic cancer still develops in a large number of patients and drug resistance occurs in the majority of them after an initial period of response and leads to cancer progression and death.\n\nAims:\n\nTo date, the mechanisms which allow cancer cells to spread through the body to form metastases and to become resistant even to the most powerful treatments are poorly understood. Our aim is to collect cancer specimens and normal tissue specimens such as blood from patients with solid tumours and to analyse these samples with some of the latest molecular profiling technologies in the research laboratory. This comprehensive analysis should reveal what molecular defects fuel the growth of cancer cells adn what allows them to spread through the body and then develop resistance to cancer therapies. Such insights could subsequently lead to the development of better more improved treatments which prevent drug resistance, to novel molecular tests which can also predict which treatment is most likely to be effective and tolerable in individual patients.\n\nMethods:\n\nTo achieve this, we aim to collect multiple samples from consenting patients starting from the diagnosis of a tumour to the time drug resistance develops more. Importantly, this study will collect tissues from interventional procedures which are performed as part of routine patient management of patients seen at Barts Health NHS trust. We will then apply molecular tests such as proteomics and DNA sequencing to these samples. Tissues which are left over after these tests have been applied will be stored in a licensed tissue bank to allow future research with novel technologies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Solid Tumours"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"St Bartholomew's Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"London","zip":"EC1A 7BE","country":"United Kingdom","contacts":[{"name":"Thomas Powles","role":"CONTACT","phone":"0207 882 8762"},{"name":"Thomas Powles, Prof","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Marco Gerlinger, Dr","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":51.50853,"lon":-0.12574}}]}}},

While there is some evidence to suggest that the use of stents improves wound healing, the decision to use a stent or not is currently up to the preference of the surgeon. To investigate the impact of stents on post-surgical healing, the investigators at Vancouver General Hospital will compare patients undergoing trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgeries with septal flap reconstruction with the use of silastic stents to line the septal donor site, and compare their recovery to those who did not receive stents. The investigators hypothesize that the use of silastic stents in endonasal surgery increases the rate of mucosal healing, and better quality mucosal regeneration, and with no effect on the patients experience after surgery. In this randomized control trial the investigators aim to recruit 26 (13 in each arm) study participants. The primary outcome is to determine the effect of silastic stunting on healing of the naso-septal flap donor site. This objective will be achieved by assessment of endoscopic photographs of healing tissue and histologic assessment of healing tissues. The secondary outcome involves questionnaires that measure the patient's subjective nasal symptoms prior to and following endoscopic skull based surgery. Total time commitment for the study participant is about 4 months across 4 study visits (all of which are part of standard of care): the assessment visit, surgery, 4 weeks post-operative follow up visit and 12 week post-operative follow up visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pituitary Tumour"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Silastic Stent"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{}}},

The purpose of Study X2203 was to identify any efficacy signal in subjects with the disease subtypes under study, when treated with pazopanib monotherapy. Furthermore, it was to define the toxicities of pazopanib in children, as well as examine biological markers, e.g. cytokines and angiogenic factors, that could help further characterize any response of pazopanib in children. Pazopanib was administered as monotherapy in tablet and powder suspension formulations at daily doses of 450 mg/m2/dose or 225 mg/m2/dose, respectively. The first 6 enrolled subjects receiving oral suspension formulation were assessed for tolerability and extended PK sampling; and, only if pazopanib was tolerated, subsequent subjects were enrolled at the same starting dose with the suspension. Dose escalation was not permitted. For the tablet, a dosing nomogram was used based on the subject's BSA. Dose reduction was dependent upon the toxicity of pazopanib and disease status of the infants, toddlers, children, adolescents, and young adults. Subjects could be as young as 1 year-old infants to screen for enrollment. Subjects were assessed for initial response after 8 weeks of treatment prior to Cycle 3. A cycle was defined as 28 days of pazopanib treatment with no rest period between cycles. Treatment was administered continuously once daily. Treatment was to be discontinued if there was evidence of disease progression, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, pregnancy. Histological classification was an important diagnostic inclusion in these subjects with a wide variety of refractory solid tumors, i.e. 7 different tumor types and each being a cohort."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Solid

Early advanced care planning (ACP) and palliative care improve goal-concordant care and symptoms and reduce unnecessary utilization. A promising strategy to increase ACP and palliative care is to identify patients at risk of mortality earlier in the disease course in order to target these services. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used in various industries, including medicine, to accurately predict risk of adverse outcomes and direct earlier resources. \"Human-machine collaborations\" - systems that leverage both ML and human intuition - have been shown to improve predictions and decision-making in various situations, but it is not known whether human-machine collaborations can improve prognostic accuracy and lead to greater and earlier ACP and palliative care. In this study, we contacted a national sample of medical oncologists and invited them complete a vignette-based survey. Our goal was to examine the association of exposure to ML mortality risk predictions with clinicians' prognostic accuracy and decision-making. We presented a series of six vignettes describing three clinical scenarios specific to a patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) that differ by age, gender, performance status, smoking history, extent of disease, symptoms and molecular status. We will use these vignette-based surveys to examine the association of exposure to ML mortality risk predictions with medical oncologists' prognostic accuracy and decision-making."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oncology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","enrollmentInfo":{"count":52,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"name":"Survey"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania","city":"Philadelphia","state":"Pennsylvania","zip":"19104","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.95233,"lon":-75.16379}}]}}},
