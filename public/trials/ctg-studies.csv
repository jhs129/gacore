Early detection and treatment of cervical lesions and standardized management have emerged as essential pillars in the Global Cervical Cancer Elimination. The loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is widely employed as a preferred approach for the diagnosis and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions and early invasive cervical cancer. Patients with high-grade cervical lesions are more prone to experiencing sexual dysfunction and psychological disorders after LEEP, attributed to the unique surgical site, physiological alterations, and psychological stress during the postoperative recovery process, thereby adversely affecting their quality of life. Currently, there is a shortage of research evidence regarding targeted intervention measures and long-term effect evaluations for sexual function quality and quality of life after LEEP for cervical lesions. In recent years, the health management model based on patient navigation has evolved into a novel modality for facilitating comprehensive tumor prevention and control. However, its effect in managing cervical lesions has yet to be comprehensively assessed.

It has been divided into four grades from I to IV on the basis of histological differentiation. Grade I is the best differentiated consisting of small tumor cells arranged in thin trabeculae. Cells with higher grade are larger and less differentiated with hyperchromatic nuclei and loss of trabecular pattern.

Ultrasound is an imaging modality frequently used to evaluate liver tumors because of its convenience, real-time, less expensive and no radiation exposure. However, ultrasonographic evaluation by conventional B-mode image is semi quantitative and subjective. It still cannot replace liver biopsy for the evaluation of HCC.

This study is aimed to quantify the image characters of B-mode image and the scatterer properties using Nakagami distribution. Nakagami parameter is a general model to describe the distribution of scatterers. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that Nakagami parameter may also reflect the histological changes in different grades of HCC.

Standard therapy for malignant tumor includes surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Despite optimal treatment the prognosis remains poor. There is an urgent need for more effective therapies. The Warburg effect has been widely observed in human cancers. The main energy supply of tumor cells are aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, they are highly dependent on glucose metabolism. Recently, some scholars have suggested that 'Restricted calorie Ketogenic Diet (RKD)' might be able to inhibit glycolysis and thus anti-tumor by restricting carbohydrate intake. This will 'starve' cancer cells, which will lead to cell death. There are many animal and in vitro studies shown that RKD can reduce the tumor size and thus tumor cell growth of malignant tumors. However, a consistent positive result can not be found within a small sample of clinical trials. In this study, 40 patients with malignant tumors will be treated with or without RKD. The safety and efficacy of RKD and the patients' tolerance will be observed in order to understand whether this therapy can be a potential new treatment This clinical study is comparatively large internationally. It is the first domestically.

Most patients are typically diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. Platinum-paclitaxel regimen has been widely adopted as a standard first-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer.

Shoulder pain is a common complaint from patients who have had abdominal surgery and the pain is thought to be related to the use of IP.

In addition to anesthesia (which keeps you asleep during surgery), the current standard practice is to block the nerve-muscle junction with a type of drug called neuromuscular blockade (NMB) which paralyzes the abdominal muscles. This means that a lower level of insufflation pressure is needed by the surgeon.

To reverse the effects of NMB after surgery, a drug called neostigmine is given.

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the use of standard-of-care moderate NMB and neostigmine to the use of deep NMB and a drug called Sugammadex when given to elderly patients (patients who are 65 years of age or older) who are scheduled to have robotic abdominal surgery. ""Deep"" and ""moderate"" in this study refers to the dose or strength of the NMB given.

This is an investigational study. Sugammadex and neostigmine are FDA approved and commercially available for the reversal of NMB.

NCT01673906,68-Ga-labeled Octreotide Analogues PET in Duodenal-pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumours,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01673906,,"The diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of having neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) has traditionally been a challenging issue. The last two decades have been marked by the application to use in the diagnosis of NETs of 3 newly available diagnostic techniques: endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), multidetector CT (MDCT), and more recently, positron emission tomography using 68Ga-labelled octreotide analogues (PET). In a prospective study conducted at a single referral centre that compared PET with conventional somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and MDCT in diagnosis, staging and follow-up of patients affected by NET, PET detected more primary and secondary lesions than other methods. Recent studies investigated the clinical impact of PET in the management of patients affected by NET, previously studied by MDCT. The investigators recently reported the results of the investigation of 19 patients suspected of having primary pancreatic NET and studied by PET, MDCT and EUS. The investigators preliminary data suggest that PET may be slightly more sensitive than MDCT in detecting small (\<2cm) pancreatic lesions; accuracy of PET and EUS is probably similar. No prospective study has yet been devoted to evaluate the accuracy of PET in the diagnosis and staging of primary duodenal-pancreatic NETs. Furthermore, the clinical impact of the adjunct of PET to the traditional protocols of diagnosis and staging of these tumours waits to be thoroughly evaluated. Thus the appropriate place of PET in the diagnostic algorithm of patients suspected of having duodenal-pancreatic NET remains undefined.

The main aim of this project is to prospectively compare the accuracy of PET and MDCT in the diagnosis and staging of patients suspected of having duodenal-pancreatic NETs. The investigators hypothesised that PET is superior to MDCT in the diagnosis of these neoplasm (the dimension of the study sample is estimated in order to detect a 10% difference). The impact of PET on management plan of affected patients will also be evaluated. As a secondary endpoint of the study, the investigators will compare EUS, PET and MDCT in the diagnosis of primary duodenal-pancreatic NET.

NCT02086721,Phase I Clinical Study Combining L19-IL2 With SABR in Patients With Oligometastatic Solid Tumor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02086721,L19-IL2,"The formation of metastasis is responsible for as much as 90% of cancer-associated mortality. In spite of recent advances in oncologic therapy, approximately 50 % of the lung cancer patients have already overt disseminated cancer at diagnosis. Additionally, numerous patients with locoregional disease initially treated with curative intent develop (oligo)metastases during the course of disease. In both instances, these stage IV patients are generally considered to be incurable and mostly treated palliatively.

Oligometastases, defined as 1-5 sites of active disease on whole body imaging, was coined to refer to isolated sites of metastasis resembling limited tumor metastatic capacity. The implication of this concept is that local cancer treatments are curative in a proportion of patients with metastases and that incorporating local therapy is a conceptually attractive approach. In several, but not all, academic centers the standard treatment of patients with oligometastases in good general health is standard chemotherapy followed by surgery or by Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) with radical dose on the macroscopic visible tumors.

The widespread introduction of SABR and of minimally invasive surgery has fuelled research in treating patients with oligometastases. Indeed, local control of metastases can be obtained in virtually all parts of the body with a low proportion of patients experiencing severe side effects. In the few prospective studies published to date, approximately 20% of patients remained free of recurrence several years after treatment when all sites of disease were targeted by radiation.

Along with standard anti-cancer therapeutic modalities like chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), immunotherapy has recently gained a lot of attention.

Angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and therefore, considerable efforts have been made to exploit this unique target for selective drug delivery. One of the appealing targets for both approaches is the splice variant of fibronectin containing extra domain B (EDB), which is abundantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells of a variety of primary tumors as well as metastases , but virtually absent in normal tissues. Recently, a human recombinant scFv fragment directed against EDB, designated L19, was developed and subsequently combined with the pro-inflammatory interleukin-2 (IL2), resulting in the immunocytokine L19-IL2. L19-IL2 delivers high doses of IL2 to the (metastatic) tumor site(s) exploiting the selective expression of EDB on newly formed blood vessels. Interleukin-2 (IL2) plays an essential role in the activation phases of both specific and natural immune responses. Even though it has no direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, it can induce tumor regression by stimulating a potent cell-mediated response. In summary, L19-IL2 is an immunocytokine which will stimulate immune response specifically in tumors with angiogenesis and tissue remodeling.

Radiotherapy is a particularly interesting partner for immunotherapy, since it can be harnessed to specifically modify the immunogenicity of the primary tumors and their microenvironment, in the attempt to generate an in situ immunization of the host against a patient's own cancer. Our hypothesis is that three independent therapeutic approaches will synergize to improve dramatically survival in patients with oligometastases of solid tumors.",NO,Solid Tumour,DRUG: L19-IL2,"Toxicity (CTCAE 4.0), three months",Maastricht Radiation Oncology,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",INTERVENTIONAL,2015-12,2017-05,"MAASTRO clinic, Maastricht, Limburg, 6229 ET, Netherlands"

The incidence of these cardiac AEs varies according to the patient profile and the anticancer molecules used, but their impact on the morbidity and mortality of the patients is significant.

In this context, we started at the University Hospital of Caen Normandy in September 2017 a cardio-oncology program entitled ""prevention and pharmacological management of cardiac adverse effects induced by drugs used in Oncology"" (PICARO program). This program involves the pharmacology department (opening of a dedicated consultation), the cardiology department (opening of a dedicated ultrasound consultation), vascular medicine departement (opening of a dedicated consultation) and the oncology federation. This program aims to be regional in the future. We therefore propose to build a cohort backed up to the PICARO program to assess the regional impact of cardiac AEs of anticancer drugs and thus to be better able to specify the number of AEs, the incidence and regional prevalence of these drugs. .

The constitution of this cohort is only the first step towards the constitution in the near future (2 years) of an observatory and then a regional registry of cardiac AEs induced by anticancer drugs. The objectives associated with the establishment of such a registry would be to reduce the number of cardiac AEs, the hospitalizations caused by these AEs, a better information of health professionals and patients, an improvement in the screening of patients at risk, all coming back in the context of health, clinical, epidemiological and pharmacological surveillance.",NO,Cardio-oncology,OTHER: observational cohort with plasma samples,"Number of Participants With AntiCancer Drugs-Related Cardiac Adverse Events during the follow-up, 2 years","University Hospital, Caen",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",OBSERVATIONAL,2019-02-26,2020-09-10,"CHU Caen, Caen, Normandy, 14000, France"

NCT04813913,VASCular Impact of Angiogenic Treatment in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04813913,VASCATAQ,"Antiangiogenic treatments are used in many tumor locations such as metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a significant improvement in carcinological results on overall survival and / or progression-free survival. However, their use is characterized by an increase in side effects and in particular cardiovascular effects such as high blood pressure (hypertension). One of the main classes of antiangiogens used in this indication is that of monoclonal antibodies, the leader of which is bevacizumab (Avastin®, Roche, Bale, Switzerland). Bevacizumab works by inhibiting endothelial vascular growth factor-dependent neoangiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF). In the reference studies, the inhibition of VEGF, whether extracellular (monoclonal antibody directed against VEGFA) or intracellular (receptor inhibitors with tyrosine kinase activity), induces hypertension of all grades, observed in 25% to 40 % of patients including 8 to 17% of severe grades (≥ grade 3 NCI-CTCAE). In terms of pathophysiology, inhibition of VEGFA results in a decrease in the availability of nitric oxide (NO) at the endothelial level and the appearance of arteriolar rarefaction. This induces an increase in peripheral resistance responsible ultimately for an increase in blood pressure. The occurrence of hypertension induced by anti-VEGF treatment seems to be predictive of the carcinological response in certain oncological situations such as metastatic breast cancer9, glioblastoma and mRCC. Furthermore, it has also been shown that there is an early attack on the elastic conductance arteries (branches of the aorta and its main ones) characterized by an increase in their rigidity in patients exposed to a VEGF receptor inhibitor with tyrosine activity. kinase or bevacizumab. This increase, whose poor prognostic impact is known at the cardiovascular level is largely independent of the rise in blood pressure and reflects a direct toxicity of treatments at the level of the artery wall. This increase in rigidity, refused when the pressure rises, would be predictive of a low carcinological response rate at 6 months. However, these data are based on populations that are heterogeneous in terms of carcinology and the position prior to or concomitant with other antineoplastic treatments.

In this context, the evaluation of arterial stiffness in the same patient population would make it possible to better define the involvement of the conductive arteries in a clearly defined clinical situation. Joint measurements of the plasma concentration of the treatment as well as those of factors derived from the endothelium and circulating tumor markers which, to our knowledge, have never been carried out in these patients, would make it possible to better specify the mechanisms of involvement and the links between exposure, arterial toxicity and carcinologic efficacy of bevacizumab.

Its targets include multiple cell cycle regulating proteins, cytokines and growth factors. In some cancers, its overall expression level but especially its cytoplasmic expression are correlated to a higher grade and constitute a poor prognostic factor. To date, HuR's deregulation mechanisms remain poorly understood. A few experimental studies have shown the role of certain microARNS, or of post-translational modifications. In brain tumours, HuR expression, its prognostic value and its deregulation mechanisms have been little studied to date.

The first part of the project will be a monocentric retrospective study of human brain tumour samples collected during biopsies or surgical removal. We will first evaluate HuR expression in 140 brain tumors, including 40 meningiomas and 100 gliomas of increasing grade, and look for a correlation with histological grade and survival. We will then apprehend the consequences of its deregulation by analyzing different factors involved in the cell cycle and stress response markers. Finally, we will study the mechanisms of HuR deregulation by analyzing the expression level of several microRNAs (miR16, miR519) and the methylation state of HuR.

NCT03572192,Tissue Collection Framework To Improve Outcomes In Solid Tumours,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03572192,,"Background:

Cancer therapies have significantly improved over the last decades, allowing cancer specialists to keep cancer under control for longer than ever before. However, metastatic cancer still develops in a large number of patients and drug resistance occurs in the majority of them after an initial period of response and leads to cancer progression and death.

Aims:

To date, the mechanisms which allow cancer cells to spread through the body to form metastases and to become resistant even to the most powerful treatments are poorly understood. Our aim is to collect cancer specimens and normal tissue specimens such as blood from patients with solid tumours and to analyse these samples with some of the latest molecular profiling technologies in the research laboratory. This comprehensive analysis should reveal what molecular defects fuel the growth of cancer cells adn what allows them to spread through the body and then develop resistance to cancer therapies. Such insights could subsequently lead to the development of better more improved treatments which prevent drug resistance, to novel molecular tests which can also predict which treatment is most likely to be effective and tolerable in individual patients.

Methods:

To achieve this, we aim to collect multiple samples from consenting patients starting from the diagnosis of a tumour to the time drug resistance develops more. Importantly, this study will collect tissues from interventional procedures which are performed as part of routine patient management of patients seen at Barts Health NHS trust. We will then apply molecular tests such as proteomics and DNA sequencing to these samples. Tissues which are left over after these tests have been applied will be stored in a licensed tissue bank to allow future research with novel technologies.",NO,Solid Tumours,,"Identification of molecular determinants of drug resistance, tumour progression or treatment toxicity., 30years",Queen Mary University of London,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",OBSERVATIONAL,2013-09,2043-08,"St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, EC1A 7BE, United Kingdom"

To produce this catalog, five types of cancer were selected: non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer.

The metagenomic analysis of a group of five different types of cancers introduces a lot of heterogeneity which is favorable to the richness of a catalog. For non-small cell lung cancer treated with immune control point inhibitors, two stool collections will be performed per patient (one stool collection before setting up an immune control point inhibitor and one collection after one month of being inhibited Of immune control point) to assess the impact of the immune control point inhibitor on the microbiota (pilot study).

NCT03282058,Silastic Stent Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03282058,,"Endoscopic skull base surgery is a relatively new procedure that is now a standard of care for surgeries at the base of the skull; however there are no studies that examine the healing process of the nasal lining with the use of silastic (silicone) stents (or splints) that might be placed at the time of surgery. While there is some evidence to suggest that the use of stents improves wound healing, the decision to use a stent or not is currently up to the preference of the surgeon. To investigate the impact of stents on post-surgical healing, the investigators at Vancouver General Hospital will compare patients undergoing trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgeries with septal flap reconstruction with the use of silastic stents to line the septal donor site, and compare their recovery to those who did not receive stents. The investigators hypothesize that the use of silastic stents in endonasal surgery increases the rate of mucosal healing, and better quality mucosal regeneration, and with no effect on the patients experience after surgery. In this randomized control trial the investigators aim to recruit 26 (13 in each arm) study participants. The primary outcome is to determine the effect of silastic stunting on healing of the naso-septal flap donor site. This objective will be achieved by assessment of endoscopic photographs of healing tissue and histologic assessment of healing tissues.

Early advanced care planning (ACP) and palliative care improve goal-concordant care and symptoms and reduce unnecessary utilization.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used in various industries, including medicine, to accurately predict risk of adverse outcomes and direct earlier resources. ""Human-machine collaborations"" - systems that leverage both ML and human intuition - have been shown to improve predictions and decision-making in various situations, but it is not known whether human-machine collaborations can improve prognostic accuracy and lead to greater and earlier ACP and palliative care.

NCT02677142,Evaluating the Efficacy of a Group Social Skills Intervention,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02677142,,"Tumours affecting the brain are a very heterogeneous group of diseases. Accordingly, treatment strategies vary widely depending on child's age, tumour location, its resectability and histology. As a group, however, the survival rate of childhood brain tumors has improved in recent years, resulting in an increased number of survivors returning to school and reintegrating into their communities. Survival for many of them, however, has also come with severe costs such as neurocognitive and academic difficulties. Cognitive rehabilitation strategies to address these deficits have been a major focus of recent research. Evidence is now also mounting for social competence deficits among this population which may persist into late adolescence and adulthood, thereby negatively affecting long-term survivorship. Thus, there is an urgency to identify psychosocial interventions, such as social skills programs, that can reduce the social competence deficits in childhood brain tumor survivors and, therefore, modify the course of these outcomes to ensure that survivors thrive and become productive members of society. To date, no rigorous social skills intervention trials have been undertaken to address the social difficulties of these survivors.

However, a high proportion of patients with stage 1 NSCLC are elderly and/or have medical co-morbidities and are therefore at higher risk of surgical complications. The optimal treatment for these patients is unknown. SABR may be an equally appropriate treatment but this need to be formally assessed. Funded by the NIHR Research for Patient Benefit, SABRtooth is a UK multi-centre, two-group individually randomised controlled feasibility study of patients with peripheral stage I non-small cell lung cancer considered at higher risk from surgery. In total, 54 patients are planned to be recruited from 4 treatment sites and 2 referral sites. This study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of performing a largescale definitive randomised phase III trial comparing surgery with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). The qualitative substudy is an exploration of the reasons for nonparticipation in the SABRTooth trial. As the two treatments are very different, patients may have a strong preference for either surgery or SABR, or may feel uncomfortable to have a decision between such distinct options taken out of their hands. Understanding why patients choose not to participate or do not take up their treatment allocation will be crucial in demonstrating that recruiting to a larger scale phase III trial is feasible.

NCT06674889,Rehabilitation Outcomes Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06674889,,"This pilot health services interventional study aims to prospectively assess the effectiveness of a pre-treatment rehabilitation (prehabilitation) program across a diverse cohort of adult cancer patients via a randomized pilot trial. Upon screening and identification of high-risk features through a central navigation process, patients referred to oncology clinics will be approached to participate in tailored prehabilitation interventions. The study will track and analyze functional outcomes and quality of life aiming to demonstrate the comprehensive benefits of prehabilitation on the cancer treatment continuum. We hypothesize that this referral program is feasible and that those randomized to the intervention arm will have superior functional outcomes and global health-related quality of life.

The rationale for this study is anchored in the urgent need to optimize the cancer care trajectory for high-risk patients whose treatment outcomes and quality of life are jeopardized by the multifaceted challenges of their disease. While prehabilitation has shown potential to mitigate these adverse effects, the optimal methods for identifying and connecting these high-risk individuals to appropriate prehabilitation resources remain underexplored. This study, with its systematic approach to enrolling a diverse adult cancer population, endeavors to investigate not only the benefits of prehabilitation interventions but also the effectiveness of a targeted referral process.

NCT02587455,Pembrolizumab and Palliative Radiotherapy in Lung,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02587455,PEAR,"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK with around 43,500 new patients diagnosed each year. About 69% of patients are diagnosed with advanced stage disease and at present these patients would be expected to survive for less than 12 months. These statistics therefore show the need for the development of new effective drugs in the treatment of advanced Lung cancer.

Recent trial results have shown the efficacy of immunotherapy in treating several types of tumours including lung cancer. These tumours are known to express a high level of a glycoprotein called PDL1 which is a component of the PD1 pathway. In cancer the PD1 pathway can be hijacked by tumours leading to the immune system being suppressed. The aim of the new drug Pembrolizumab is to restart the PD1 pathway and use the immune system to help fight the cancer cells. Radiotherapy has also been shown to cause cancer to increase production of the proteins that can block the immune system. Therefore it has been proposed that combine of new immunotherapy agent such as pembrolizumab and radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer will allow more cancer cells to be killed through the immune system.

The purpose of this study is to see if pembrolizumab can safety be combined with standard palliative radiotherapy in patients with lung cancer.

NCT02991105,Epidemiology of Cancer After Solid Organ Transplantation - EpCOT Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02991105,EpCOT,"Cancer remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality post solid organ transplantation. While mortality from the other leading causes of death post-transplantation (e.g. cardiovascular disease and infection) is declining, mortality from cancer post-transplantation is increasing. This is due to both general and transplant-specific risk factors that combine to increase risk for cancer compared to the general population. However, there is a shortage of research exploring cancer epidemiology post solid organ transplantation in the UK. This is essential to guide clinicians and for counselling patients regarding expectations and outcomes after developing cancer post-transplantation. This is especially important as the aetiology, pathophysiology and outcomes of cancer post-transplantation may differ from the general population.

Available data registries in the UK separately contain valuable cancer and transplant-specific data that can be combined to explore cancer epidemiology post-transplantation more comprehensively, which can be directly translated into patient benefit by utilizing transplant-specific data (rather than translating from general population or non-UK patient demographics).

The purpose of this project is to combine existing data resources to link up the complete patient journey for solid organ transplant recipients nationally and focus on the entire spectrum of cancer from incidence to mortality.",NO,Malignancy,,"Cancer-related mortality after solid organ transplantation, To compare observed and expected risks of specific causes of deaths, in particular cancer-related death, by linking the UKTR with the national death registry to obtain underlying causes of death and determine factors related to increased risk of specific causes of death post-transplantation.

NCT03435952,Pembrolizumab with Intratumoral Injection of Clostridium Novyi-NT,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03435952,,"Some tumors are difficult to treat with chemotherapy or radiation. One of the reasons is that areas of the tumor do not have many blood vessels, which makes it difficult for drugs to reach those areas. One way that researchers have recently tried to overcome this problem is by injecting special kinds of bacteria into the tumors. These bacteria have been genetically changed to remove the chemicals that are poisonous to humans, but are still able to cause tumor cells to break down and die. The idea is that these bacteria may be able to assist chemotherapy drugs in fighting cancer.

The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of one of these bacterial therapies (Clostridium novyi-NT spores) that can be given in combination with pembrolizumab to patients with advanced solid tumors. The safety of this drug will also be studied, as well as whether it can help to control the disease.

This is an investigational study. Clostridium novyi-NT is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of melanoma and different types of head and neck and non-small cell lung cancers.

Even in patients who relapse after first line therapy, a durable remission rate of between 25% and 60% has been seen using further chemotherapy. In 1999, researchers at St Bartholomew's Hospital developed the GAMEC protocol (combination chemotherapy with filgrastim, actinomycin D, methotrexate, etoposide, cisplatin). Results from this study showed that 50% of patients with relapsed testicular cancer could be cured using this treatment. When we reviewed the individual patients it was clear that older patients (\>35yrs) or patients with a raised Lactate Dehydrogenase (a blood test that monitors cancer activity), did not do as well. In addition, patients whose original tumour started in their chest (mediastinal germ cell tumour) have tended to do badly if they relapse. We have been developing a study for patients who fulfil at least one of these criteria. The GAMIO study (filgrastim, actinomycin D, methotrexate, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) has recently closed due to problems with high levels of toxicity from the irinotecan. GAMMA is a new study that will use paclitaxel instead of irinotecan and oxaliplatin instead of cisplatin. We expect that this treatment with oxaliplatin will be less damaging to the kidneys than cisplatin. Both oxaliplatin and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin and irinotecan have similar activity in relapsed patients in the phase II setting. We hope to improve on our previous results with this substitution and see if this will lead to an improvement in the cure rate of relapsed germ cell tumours with poor prognosis and reduce the side effects compared to our standard treatment.

- Certain types of cancers, including sarcoma and melanoma, have specific antigens (protein molecules) on their surfaces. Research has shown that producing an immune reaction to these antigens may be able to keep tumors from growing by encouraging the immune system to destroy the tumor cells. By creating a vaccine that contains antigens similar to those found on the cancer cells, researchers hope to cause an immune reaction that targets the cancer cells. However, more research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of this type of vaccine treatment.

Objectives:

- To determine whether a tumor cell vaccine, given to individuals who have had surgery to remove malignant tumors from the chest, can cause an immune reaction that will prevent the tumors from coming back.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with cancer that has spread to the lungs, pleura, or mediastinum, and have recently had surgery to remove tumors in the chest.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well as blood tests and imaging studies.
* Participants will have the option to have leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for studies on how the body is responding to the vaccine. Participants who agree to have this procedure will have it before the start of treatment and after the sixth and eighth vaccines.
* Seven days before the first vaccine, participants will receive the chemotherapy drugs celecoxib and cyclophosphamide to take twice a day at home.
* Participants will receive the experimental vaccine as an injection in the thigh or arm, and may receive it in two shots depending on how many cells are in each vaccine. Participants will receive a diary to monitor medication doses and side effects, as well as additional cyclophosphamide and celecoxib to take at home as directed by the study.
* Participants will have one vaccine every month for 6 months, and will have regular blood tests and imaging studies. After the sixth vaccine, participants who have successfully responded to the treatment will have two additional vaccines given 3 months apart.

A main contributor is the increasing use of chemo- and radiotherapy during end of life (EoL: the last 12 months of life). Importantly, intensive chemotherapy in EoL has uncertain efficacy, may result in frequent hospitalizations and less time spent at home. Also, patients with incurable disease who receive intensive treatment at EoL have worse quality of life (QoL). A systematic palliative care (PC) approach that focuses on optimal symptom management and maintenance of QoL of patients and family is often introduced too late in the disease trajectory. Studies indicate that early introduction of PC in patients with unfavorable prognosis may improve QoL and other symptoms and prolong survival. These and related findings have made international stakeholders advocate a stronger integration of oncology and PC for patients with incurable cancer.

The present project is a national multicenter cluster-randomized trial (RCT) in 12 oncology departments in all 4 Norwegian health regions.

The test is based on two well-known phenomena in biology. First, when cells in the body die, short fragments of their DNA, about 150 bases long, find their way into the bloodstream for a short period of time of about fifteen minutes to an hour, before being eliminated in the liver and kidney. The details of this process are not fully known, but it is clear that the phenomenon exists. Already today, this phenomenon is widely used clinically for prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal aberrations in the DNA of the fetus that is found in large quantities in the mother's blood. Liquid biopsies from cancer have already been developed, based on the identification of somatic mutations originating from a cancerous tumor in the free DNA found in the serum or plasma. In the case of cancer, liquid biopsies may be a convenient way to monitor the genetic evolution of the tumor, response to treatments, and more. This approach of detecting cell death using free DNA in the bloodstream has a severe limitation when it comes to the death of cells whose genome is not different from the genome of the other tissues in the body, and therefore the DNA cannot be associated with the tissue of origin based on sequence analysis.",NO,Malignancies,,"Improvement of liver function tests including ALT and AST levels after immunosuppression, Reduction of liver enzymes following immunosuppression treatment, Measurements of liver enzymes after diagnosis of acute rejection",Hadassah Medical Organization,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",OBSERVATIONAL,2024-08-01,2027-11-01,"Hdassah Hospital, Jerusalem, 9112001, Israel"

Overexpression of aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) and/or integrin αvβ3 in endothelial and tumor cells is an essential marker of tumor-associated angiogenesis. It is highly expressed in malignant tissues such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer but less expressed in normal tissues. Therefore, CD13 and αvβ3 are important targets for diagnosis and efficacy assessment in ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Single receptor targeting probes have many disadvantages, such as relatively low binding affinity, short tumor retention time, and low tumor uptake. RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) and NGR (Asp-Gly-Arg) are recognized peptide sequences targeting CD13 or αvβ3. PET imaging with 68Ga-HX01, a radionuclide 68Ga labeled peptide isomer formed from RGD and NGR, can be helpful for targeted diagnosis and efficacy assessment of malignant tumors.

NCT06075888,Metagenomic Sequencing for the Identification of Pathogens in Febrile Neutropenic Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06075888,ADNEMIA,"The development of targeted therapies and intensive protocols in oncohaematology has improved the survival of patients with haematological malignancies. The increase in the number of patients treated and their life expectancy has been accompanied by an increase in the incidence of infectious complications secondary to the immunosuppression induced by these therapies.

Febrile neutropenia (NF) is a complication that occurs in approximately 10% to 15% of patients treated for solid tumours and up to 100% of patients treated for haematological malignancies, particularly after bone marrow and/or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

In 25% to 30% of cases, NF leads to serious complications. The vast majority of NF cases are caused by microbial infections (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc.), which can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if appropriate treatment is not initiated rapidly (introduction of anti-infective molecules and implementation of associated procedures). If no pathogen is identified during the management of the most severe patients, the prognosis is poor, with a mortality rate of 10%.

The performance of diagnostic strategies is therefore an important factor in improving the prognosis of these patients.

Specific aims are to assess the feasibility (Aim 1) and the possible effects of the FTI (Aim 2).

The core elements in the intervention are to support: 1) the families in talking about the illness and related subjects, 2) the parents in understanding the needs of their children and how to support them, and 3) the families in identifying their strengths and how to use them. FTI entails six meetings with two interventionists (with the whole family and with the individual members of the family) at 1-2 weekly intervals.

Physical activity also has a protective effect in terms of tertiary prevention by reducing the risk of recurrence of certain cancers (breast, colon, prostate) by around 40 to 50% and by reducing overall mortality.

Adapted physical activity (APA) is offered at the Institut de Cancérologie de l'Ouest (ICO) in Angers, but there are obstacles particularly linked to the geographical distance of the establishment where this activity is offered.

The RAPASS project is a prospective study which will be proposed to patients followed at the ICO, living in rural areas and far from Angers. Its main objective is to describe the fatigue and quality of life of patients before, during and after a 13-session home-based APA programme.

Over a period of 18 months, ending in December 1994, 10,080 women were recruited into our study, after informed consent was obtained. At the initial recruitment visit, all women were administered a brief risk factor questionnaire, had 15ml of blood collected and, if sexually active, were given a pelvic examination. At the time of the pelvic examination, a Pap smear was collected, as were additional cervical cells which were then used for additional monolayer smears (ThinPrep) and for human papillomavirus and other testing. Pictures of the cervix, known as cervigrams, were also taken as a third screening test. Based on these screening tests, women were referred to colposcopy, at which time a more detailed risk factor questionnaire was administered, additional cervical cells and blood (15ml) were collected, and histological specimens were obtained, if indicated by the colposcopy. Women diagnosed with a high-grade cervical lesion (HSIL) or cervical cancer were treated by Social Security Administration clinicians using standard local protocols.

Women without evidence of HSIL or cancer at enrollment comprise the group of subjects who have been followed as part of our longitudinal study. Three distinct groups of women of approximately equal size (about 3,000 women each) exist within our longitudinal cohort. The first group consists of women who at enrollment had evidence of low-grade cervical lesions (LSIL) or equivocal lesions and a sample of the remaining cohort members. This group is being followed actively at 6-12 month intervals through their seventh anniversary in the cohort. The second group consists of women who were cytologically normal at enrollment but randomly selected for active follow-up. This second group will be seen once after enrollment, at their fifth anniversary in the cohort. Women in this group with evidence of LSIL at the fifth anniversary visit will be added to the first group described above and followed at 6-month intervals. The final group consists of the remaining women in our cohort (all cytologically normal at enrollment). These women are being followed passively via linkage to the cytology and tumor registries in Cost Rica.

Clinical visits conducted during follow-up consist of a brief personal interview that collects information on exposures since enrollment, the collection of 15ml blood, and a pelvic examination. Pap smear is prepared during the pelvic examination, and additional cervical specimens are collected and used to prepare a monolayer smear (ThinPrep) and for human papillomavirus and other testing. Similar to the enrollment visit, cervigrams are also collected from each participant at the time of their follow-up visits.

NCT04060472,Paclitaxel (Albumin-bound) and Oxaliplatin for Advanced Hepatobiliary and Malignant Tumors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04060472,,"1. Advantages of albumin-bound paclitaxel Paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding type) uses human serum albumin (HAS) as a carrier, and paclitaxel and HSA are made into paclitaxel-bound albumin nanoparticles by a high-pressure homogenization technique. After injection of paclitaxel (albumin-binding) into the blood, it rapidly disintegrates and disperses into a smaller albumin-paclitaxel complex, which binds and activates the gp60 albumin receptor on vascular endothelial cells, interacts with Caveolin on the cell membrane, and then is transported to the tumor intercellular substance by transcytosis. Tumor cells can secrete a SPARC protein with a specific affinity for albumin, which actively captures the albumin-paclitaxel complex in the tumor stroma and accumulates around the tumor cells. Since tumor neovascular endothelial cells highly express gp60 receptor and the SPARC protein is also highly expressed in the tumor region, the special transport mechanism of ""gp60- Caveolin / caveola -SPARC protein"" makes the paclitaxel for injection (albumin binding) have unique targeting and penetrating properties toward tumor tissues, hence the drug is highly concentrated in the tumor tissue, which can better increase the therapeutic effect and reduce the damage to normal tissues.

Paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding type) has the following advantages: (1) it is unnecessary to pre-administer anti-allergic drugs, the infusion time is within 30 min, and patients have good compliance; (2) due to its higher safety, the dosage can be given as high as 260-300 mg/m2; (3) it makes full use of gp60 / cysteine acid secretory protein (SPARC protein) channel to make the drug enrich toward the tumor area, and the effect is good; (4) as the dosage is within 80 \~ 300 mg/m2, the AUC increase proportionally with the administered dose, \]the body is linearly metabolized., the half-life period does not prolong with the dose, and the clinical medication is safe and controllable. Currently, the drug has been approved for breast cancer treatment in China; approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer treatment; approved for gastric cancer treatment in Japan; and NCCN guidelines recommend it for the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer.

In summary, based on the biological advantages of albumin-binding paclitaxel such as high-distribution, high-dose, high-efficiency, and low-toxicity, the reported good clinical benefit and safety for hepatobiliary and malignant tumors, and the limited data about albumin-bound paclitaxel + oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment for advanced hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancies, especially in Chinese patients, our center believes that is feasible and necessary to explore the effectiveness and safety of paclitaxel for injection (albumin-binding) combined with oxaliplatin as the first-line drugs for treatment of advanced oxaliplatin-based malignant tumors.

2 Purposes To evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel (albumin-bound) combined with oxaliplatin as the first-line drugs for treatment of advanced hepatobiliary and malignant tumors.

Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) Secondary study endpoints: disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and incidence and severity of adverse events (AE).

NCT06443138,Preparation for Medical and Surgical Procedures in Oncogeriatry.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06443138,PRIMECHO,"Surgical management is one of the most frequently used interventions in the treatment of many cancers, but it can be associated with a high risk of postoperative complications.

The maintenance and optimization of functional abilities before, during and after treatment are major for elderly cancer patients, as it is now well established that there is a link between the level of functional capacity and the occurrence of these complications.

The scientific literature shows that the benefits of pre- and post-operative training programs, but these benefits only apply to a fraction of the patients adhering to the programs. The modalities of intervention (training load, follow-up, etc.) as well as patient involvement in these programs are major issues that need to be addressed to optimize their benefits.

Individualizing pre-habilitation, on the basis of the management of the training load, and therefore objective fatigue, would enable better patient adherence to the program, and optimize its benefits.

In this context, the PRIMECHO project aims to individualize pre-habilitation in order to improve functional of patients in the pre-habilitation or accelerated recovery after surgery phase.

NCT06643026,Sensory Evaluation of Taste and Smell in Oncology,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06643026,SENSEO,"Nutritional status is a major issue in the management of cancer patients. Forty to 60% of patients are undernourished at diagnosis. This undernutrition has a direct impact on patients' health and quality of life, with a reduction in survival associated with an increase in the risk of toxicity from anti-cancer treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery), the risk of infection and the risk of hospitalization. Thus, it is estimated that 10-20% of cancer patients die from the consequences of their undernutrition rather than from the tumor itself (Muscaritoli et al. 2021).

It is therefore recommended to systematically implement a multimodal nutritional intervention in cancer patients (recommendations of the learned societies ESPEN, ESMO and ASCO), combining nutritional support (oral and/or enteral and/or parenteral) with physical exercise (Muscaritoli et al. 2021). However, despite the systematic provision of dietary management, the effectiveness of nutritional interventions varies from patient to patient in terms of nutritional status, quality of life and overall survival (Cintoni et al. 2023).

Among the factors impacting patient compliance with dietary measures and their efficacy, sensory alterations occurring under chemotherapy potentially have a major impact (Drareni et al., 2019).

Indeed, the vast majority of patients describe an alteration in tastes and smells after starting chemotherapy treatment. However, few studies have focused on the specific parameters associated with these alterations.

NCT01646775,The Effect of Epidural Fentanyl on Immune Function,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01646775,,"Background: For cancer to grow and metastasize, inflammatory and immunologic conditions in the host must be favorable. The perioperative period provides inflammatory and immunologic changes that may be pro-malignant. Anesthetic medications, including the use of opioid medication, may contribute to these changes.

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that perioperative immunologic changes in patients undergoing resection of hepatic colorectal cancer recurrence, as measured by natural killer cell function and cytokine levels, will undergo less alterations in those who receive only epidural bupivacaine, as compared to those who receive epidural bupivacaine and fentanyl.

Methods: In this double blind control trial patients with no extra-hepatic evidence of cancer, undergoing a planned curative resection of hepatic recurrence of colorectal cancer, will be randomized to receive an epidural with bupivacaine and fentanyl, or bupivacaine alone. No other perioperative opioid medication will be given, and post-operative analgesia will be supplemented with acetaminophen and gabapentin.

NCT02125058,Intracutaneous Versus Transcutaneous Sutures in the Face (IC vs TC Sutures),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02125058,,"Rationale:

Skin cancer is common in Caucasians and often exists on sun-exposed areas, such as the face. Treatment of choice is mostly excision and result in an irreversible scar. As the incidence of skin cancer is rising, also among young people, it is important to obtain a good cosmetic outcome after treatment. It is believed that the type of closure of the wound after excision can influence the cosmetic result. Currently, primary closure of the excision can occur by transcutaneous (TC) or intracutaneous (IC) suturing. Both techniques are widely used among dermatologists and plastic surgeons and the choice is mainly dependent on the preference of the physician. Research comparing the cosmetic result of both techniques in the craniofacial area is lacking.

Objective:

Evaluation of the cosmetic result of transcutaneous sutures versus intracutaneous sutures in the craniofacial area.

Study design:

A randomized controlled single-blinded multi-center trial.

Study population:

Patients older than 18 years, with craniofacial skin tumor receiving surgery followed by primary closure at the department of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery of the Maastricht University Medical Centre, the department of Dermatology of Catharina hospital Eindhoven and the department of Plastic surgery of Orbis Medical Centre Sittard.

Intervention:

Excision of the tumor followed by IC sutures or TC sutures

Main study endpoints:

Cosmetic result measured on the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) by the patient and the researcher 12 months after surgery.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

All patients who participate have an indication for excision and will be assigned to one of the suture techniques. Both techniques are widely used in the regular patient care. Therefore, no extra risks are associated with it.

Patients will be asked to visit the hospital 3 months and 1 year following treatment, at which point a questionnaire will be filled in and the redness of the scar will be measured by means of non-invasive techniques.

NCT06826950,Impact of Pharmacy Services on Gynaecology Chemotherapy Safety,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06826950,,"What was studied? We wanted to see whether having pharmacists closely involved in cancer care improves medication safety and reduces severe side effects for patients with gynecologic cancers (like ovarian or uterine cancer) during chemotherapy.

How was the study done?

Who participated? Patients receiving chemotherapy at Peking University First Hospital's Gynecologic Oncology Ward (September 2022-September 2024).

Two groups compared:

Standard care group: Pharmacists provided routine pharmaceutical services.

Full pharmacy care group: Pharmacists provided ongoing support, including:

Checking medications for safety.

Teaching patients how to manage side effects.

Answering questions about drugs.

Helping manage reactions like nausea or low white blood cells.

What was measured? Severe side effects (e.g., extreme nausea, appetite loss), how well doctors prescribed and monitored medications to boost white blood cells, and unplanned hospital stays.

Key findings:

Patients with full pharmacy care had:

Fewer severe side effects: Less extreme nausea, appetite loss, and dangerously low white blood cell counts.

Better management of blood cell-boosting medications: Doctors followed guidelines more closely, and patients received proper monitoring.

Fewer unplanned hospital visits: Likely due to better side effect prevention and early intervention.

Why does this matter?

For patients: Pharmacist support during chemotherapy may help you avoid severe side effects and reduce unexpected hospital stays.

For families: Knowing pharmacists are actively involved can provide reassurance about your loved one's medication safety.

For healthcare teams: Structured pharmacist collaboration improves adherence to treatment guidelines and patient outcomes.

Takeaway:

Full pharmacy care throughout chemotherapy helps protect patients' safety, reduces severe reactions, and supports smoother treatment journeys.",NO,Neoplasms|Gynaecological Oncology,OTHER: comprehensive pharmaceutical care|OTHER: Routine pharmaceutical services,"Degree of myelosuppression, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 3 weeks",Peking University First Hospital,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",OBSERVATIONAL,2024-10-08,2024-12-31,"Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100034, China"

NCT03855969,Central Venous Access Device Removal in Cancer Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03855969,,"Background:

Central venous catheters are frequently used during cancer treatment with the aim of venepreservation. It can facilitate venous access for the safe administration of irritating or vesicant intravenous cancer medications and / or other fluids, to collect blood samples or to ensure accurate venous access for contrast during medical imaging. In addition, this means more comfort for the patient who needs to be punctured less peripherally. However, central venous catheters can also be a source of bloodstream infections and other complications, leading to increased morbidity and hospital costs (1). In our hospital, there is a general practice that if an infection of the device is suspected, the central venous catheter should be removed if antibiotics do not seem or prove to be effective.

The objective of this trial is to assess the frequency of implanted port catheter-removal in cancer patients due to suspected infection of the device in a particular oncology center over a time period of seven years. Furthermore, evidence for real device infections (per/post-surgery) and the potential contribution of different (institution-specific) risk factors on device infection will be explored. There will be focused on implanted port catheters only, as this is the main used central venous access device within the oncological population.

Trial objectives:

The primary aim of this retrospective descriptive trial is to evaluate the frequency of implanted port catheter-removal in cancer patients due to suspected infection of the device, over a time period of seven years.

The secondary aim is to examine whether the device infection could be confirmed during or after removal of the device.

At last, the tertiary aim is to verify whether certain variables can be denoted as potential risk factors for central venous access infection.

The investigators currently use a local hemodynamic protocol based on the data of the literature. According to this protocol, specific patients may require cardiac index and central venous oxygen saturation monitoring. the investigators chose to monitor the cardiac index (CI) with the transpulmonary thermodilution technique (TPTD) (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical System, Munich, Allemagne). The technique is based on the injection of a cooled bolus of saline into a central vein with a central venous catheter (CVC). The variation of temperature is measured with an arterial femoral catheter and allows the assessment of the cardiac output according to Stewart-Hamilton's theory. Many studies showed the reliability of this technique (Bein J Cardio Thorac Vasc Anesth 2004, Buhre Cardio thorac vasc anesth 1999, Felbinger J Clin ANesth 2005, Felbinger TW J Clin Anetsh 2002, Godie O Ann Thorac Surg 1999).

In our institute, most of the patients are fitted with a port for chemotherapy or parenteral nutrition. When PiCCO monitoring is necessary, a central venous catheter is inserted on the opposite side of the permanent implantable venous port. Indeed, insertion of the CVC can be more difficult because of the port. It may be interesting to use the port for TPTD in order to avoid the insertion of a new CVC. This would be possible only if the measurement of CI by the port was as reliable as the classical measurement with a CVC.

The aim of this study was to assess whether measurement of the CI by TPTD was possible and reliable via the port.

The prognosis of this cancer varies according to geographical areas, but in Europe and the USA, the 5-year survival rate has risen from less than 5% in the 1960s to around 20% in the 2000s. In the United States, however, the survival rate has risen from 5% in the 1960s to around 20% in the 2000s.

Increased the detection of premalignant lesions and early stages may improve prognosis. The presence of esophageal cancer is determined by endoscopy, biopsy and histological confirmation. However, endoscopic techniques (mucosectomy and sub mucosal dissection) are also used as curative treatment for early esophageal lesions.

Now, due to the low number of diagnoses of esophageal tumours at the superficial stage, few studies are available in Europe on the efficacy of these endoscopic techniques and on the complications resulting from their use. Similarly, little is known about the complications of endoscopic techniques and about therapeutic strategies for managing these superficial lesions.

Recent studies have gradually revealed the association between air pollution and certain cancer types (e.g., lung cancer), but its relationship with gastric cancer remains relatively unexplored. Against this background, the application of metabolomics provides new perspectives and methods to study the association between gastric cancer and environmental factors. Metabolomics is capable of systematically analysing the metabolite composition and changes in individuals under different environmental exposures, revealing the potential effects of environmental factors, such as air pollution, on individual metabolic functions. By combining air pollution data and metabolomics analysis, investigators can deeply explore the role of environmental factors in the occurrence, development and prognosis of gastric cancer, and thus provide a scientific basis for the development of prevention and treatment strategies.",NO,Gastric Cancers,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: diagnosed with gastric cancer,"Rate of postoperative complications, Surgical complications was defined as any postoperative complication occurring during the postoperative hospitalisation period., From date of surgery until the date of first documented postoperative complication, assessed up to 2 months after surgery.",Dong Peng,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",OBSERVATIONAL,2024-10-01,2026-10-01,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, Chongqing, 400016, China"

1. To develop a database of chronic treatment related toxicity in a cohort of 14750 women with stage I-III breast cancer (= non metastatic), whatever these treatments are (surgery; radiation therapy; chemotherapy ...)
2. To describe incidence, clinical presentation, and outcome of chronic toxicities.
3. To describe the psychological, the social and the economic impacts of chronic toxicities.
4. To generate predictors for chronic toxicities in order to prevent them, based upon biological criteria.

As such, all cancers (excluding non-solid cancers) will be eligible for \[68Ga\]-PSMA-617 PET imaging in this trial, for as long as their tumors express PSMA.

This study also aims to instigate the use of \[68Ga\]-PSMA-617 in the routine standard-of-care for detection and follow-up of eligible cancers.

NCT04554719,Clinical Application of Fibroblast Activation Protein PET/MRI for Diagnosis and Staging in Malignant Tumors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04554719,,"Positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis, staging of various tumors. Malignant tumor is composed of tumor cells and tumor stroma, which occupies the vast majority of the tumor. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are an important part of the tumor stroma. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is over-expressed in CAF, which is closely related to tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, immunosuppression and prognosis; and the expression level of FAP in normal tissues and organs is very low. So it becomes an excellent target for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Radionuclide-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) that specifically target to FAP as a tracer for PET imaging can be applied for targeted diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recently, some studies have found that gallium-68 (68Ga) -FAPI as a new novel positron tracer has shown to be with good application potential. In this prospective study, the investigators will use integrated PET/MR, and PET/CT with the agent 68Ga-FAPI and conventional imaging agent \[F-18\] fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) to diagnose and stage various cancers, the aim is to make up for the deficiency in FDG PET imaging in the diagnosis and staging of some cancers.",NO,Malignant Neoplasm,DRUG: 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI|DEVICE: PET/MR|DEVICE: PET/CT,"Sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI PET/MR for diagnosis and staging in some malignant tumors., For subjects with suspected or diagnosed or treated malignant tumors who have completed 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, diagnosis and staging results of 68Ga-DOTA-FAPI PET/MR, PET/CT will be compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, pathology, clinical and follow-up result., 2 years","Wuhan Union Hospital, China",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",INTERVENTIONAL,2020-05-22,2023-12-31,"China, Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, 430022, China"

NCT03348501,Study and Follow-up of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03348501,GENEM,"Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type I (MEN1) or Wermer syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease that predisposes patients to the development of endocrine tumours, principally parathyroid, pituitary or duodenal-pancreatic tumours. It is due to mutations that abolish the function of the MEN1 gene, which contributes to tumour regulation. It is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1/30,000. Penetrance of the disease is late but very high (almost 100% at 50 years of age). The first clinical manifestations usually appear after the age of 30 or 40 years.

The three cardinal endocrine characteristics of MEN1 are secreting tumours of the parathyroid, the pituitary gland and the pancreas. Tumours of the adrenal glands, bronchial or thymic endocrine tumours, ependymoma and meningioma of the central nervous system, visceral leiomyomas, and certain cutaneous tumours can also be found as well as these cardinal tumours.

The diagnosis of MEN1 is essential to ensure 1) appropriate therapeutic management of the proven endocrine manifestations 2) screening for other endocrine and non-endocrine tumours (lesions), 3) family screening of affected relatives whether they are symptomatic or not 4) the surveillance of thus diagnosed patients. Studies on mortality in MEN1 have shown that the causes of death are mainly due to the disease. The non-diagnosis of MEN1 is a cause of therapeutic failure in the management of the endocrine lesions. For the success of the surgical treatment of an isolated endocrine lesion it is important for patients to be oriented towards a diagnosis of MEN1 as the management is different from that in usual situations. Detection is thus of major importance, as early diagnosis can improve the management.

Even though the syndrome was discovered in 1903 by Erdheim and correctly documented in 1954 by Wermer, it was only in the 1970s that we became aware of the variety of clinical forms and attempted to codify its treatment. Nonetheless, published studies are fragmented and concern selected populations of few patients. They only partially answer questions arising in clinical practice concerning the prognosis and optimal management of patients. The natural history of the disease in all of its clinical forms is still poorly understood. Although advances in genetics have helped in the diagnosis of MEN1, some clinical forms are still difficult to associate with the syndrome: atypical forms, forms with hardly any symptoms and no genetic diagnosis (10%). These clinical forms need to be clarified to ensure optimal care. Only a large cohort will make it possible to describe the different forms of this disease and to clarify its prognosis",NO,Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia,OTHER: survey for long-term follow-up of the disease,"Questionnaire or Life quality, through study completion, an average of 19 years",Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Dijon,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",OBSERVATIONAL,2012-07,2031-07,"CHU Dijon Bourgogne, Dijon, 21079, France"

NCT06782022,DPD Guided 5-FU Precision Treatment in Gastro-intestinal Cancer Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06782022,COMBIGaPP,"Rationale:

Fluorouracil (5-FU) are broadly used in chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of cancers. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is a major enzyme in the 5-FU metabolism pathway. Patients with a partial or complete DPD deficiency have a strongly reduced capacity to metabolize 5-FU which may result in severe or life-threatening toxicity when treated with a standard dose of fluoropyrimidines. A partial DPD deficiency is present in 3-5% of the North American and European population. DPD deficiency is most often caused by genetic variants in the gene encoding DPD (DPYD). The four DPYD variants considered most clinically relevant and with statistically significant association with severe toxicity are DPYD\*2A (rs3918290, c.1905+1G\>A, IVS14+1G\>A), c.2846A\>T (rs67376798, D949V), c.1679T\>G (rs55886062, DPYD\*13, I560S), and c.1236G\>A (rs56038477, E412E, in haplotype B3). Prospective testing for DPD deficiency can prevent severe toxicity or mortality. Several methods have been proposed for detection of DPD deficiency, based on either genotyping of DPYD or measurement of the DPD phenotype. However, DPD deficiency is not the only factor associated with variable concentrations of 5-FU. 5-FU displays an exposure-response relationship between systemic exposure and clinical events. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) or pharmacokinetics (PK)-guided dosing of 5-FU is also considered as an alternative to ensure an acceptable exposure of 5-FU. Upfront DPD screening combined with PK guided 5-FU dosing as a tool to personalize treatment has never been studied before. In this study, we aim to investigate the PK of 5-FU for the 4 most common DPYD genetic variants, in order to better define a safe starting dose for 5-FU in DPD deficient patients.

Objectives:

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the clearance of 5-FU for the 4 most common DPYD gene variants compared to the clearance of 5-FU in DPYD wild-type patients. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the toxicity incidence and the extent of DPD deficiency as measured by Uracil Loading Test (ULT) for the 4 most common DPYD variants, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of reduced starting dose of 5-FU in patients with DPD deficiency, to demonstrate the ability to achieve a target AUC range, to establish that PK-guided 5-FU dosing decreases the incidence of 5-FU related toxicities, to establish the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the DPYD genotyping test and to optimize the sampling moment of 5-FU in order to minimize patient discomfort related to TDM procedures

Study design:

The study is designed as a single-centre prospective inception cohort study. All patients will be screened for DPD deficiency by DPYD genotyping and separated into two groups; DPYD common variants and control group. Patients with DPYD wild-type but who experience CTC grade 3-4 toxicity will also be included in this study as a toxicity group. Patients will be tested with an oral ULT to identify their DPD phenotype and measured an endogenous U/DHU ratio. Therapeutic drug monitoring will be performed to follow-up patients' 5-FU plasma concentration after start chemotherapy treatment. 5-FU plasma concentrations will be monitored until a steady state AUC of 20-30 mg.h/L is reached or maximum 4 treatment cycles is reached.

Study population:

All gastrointestinal cancer patients aged 18 years and older who are scheduled to receive treatment with fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy.

Treatment:

All patients will be treated with a standard chemotherapy regimen for their respective gastrointestinal cancer. Only 5-FU based regimens will be considered for this study. Patients will receive adjusted 5-FU doses based on their condition, including body surface area, gene activity score or DPD status, and steady state AUC from the previous dose, until their AUC reaches a target range. Patients will continue to receive regular treatment, as long as needed and/or tolerated.

Main study parameters:

The primary outcome of the study is the clearance of 5-FU at steady state (Clss) measured in ml/min. Among cancer patients treated with 5-FU, we will compare the variation in clearance between the four common DPYD variant allele carriers and DPYD wild-type carriers. The secondary study parameters are the incidence of 5-FU related toxicities, U/DHU ratio, DPD phenotype (EM, IM, and PM), 5-FU doses, dosage adjustment and time to reach target AUC (cycle number).",NO,Gastrointestinal Cancers,DRUG: 5-Fluoro-Uracil,"5-Fluorouracil pharmacokinetics, The primary objective of this study is to investigate the clearance of 5-FU at steady state (Clss) for the 4 most common DPYD gene variants, compared to the clearance of 5-FU at steady state (Clss) in DPYD wild-type patients and the clearance of 5-FU at steady state (Clss) in assumed DPYD wild-type patients with early grade 3-4 toxicity in order to better define a safe starting dose for 5-FU in DPD deficient patients., From enrollment to the end of treatment cycle 4 (the length of each cycle is 14 days)",Jan Gerard Maring,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",INTERVENTIONAL,2020-02-02,2023-08-22,"Isala Hospital Zwolle, Zwolle, 8025 AB, Netherlands"

NCT06878222,Iparomlimab and Tuvonralimab Combined with Paclitaxel and Cisplatin As Neoadjuvant Therapy for CC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06878222,,"Currently, the survival rate of locally advanced cervical cancer is low, posing a significant challenge in the treatment of cervical cancer. Radical chemoradiotherapy is considered the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. However, 23.3% to 34.4% of patients still experience recurrence or subsequent metastasis. Radical surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an alternative to concurrent chemoradiotherapy, but it also has limitations: for approximately 9.8% to 30.6% of patients who do not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, effective local treatment may be delayed. Additionally, more than 30% of patients still require adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy after surgery, significantly increasing the risk of complications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore alternative or improved treatment methods for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer.

An increasing number of women are being diagnosed with cervical cancer during their childbearing years, many of whom have a desire to preserve their fertility. For selected patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer, options include abdominal radical trachelectomy or radical trachelectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, compared to conservative surgeries such as conization or partial cervical resection, radical trachelectomy is associated with less favorable fertility rates and pregnancy outcomes, with significantly higher rates of infertility, miscarriage, and preterm birth. For patients with stage IB3 or IIA1-IIA2 cervical cancer, the current standard surgical approach is radical hysterectomy, which does not preserve fertility. Current research suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy can shrink tumor size, decrease lymph node and distant metastases, and reduce the need for postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. This offers hope for young cervical cancer patients who wish to preserve fertility, as it may reduce tumor size, thereby allowing for less extensive fertility-sparing surgery, improving pregnancy outcomes, or even making fertility-sparing surgery a viable option.

In recent years, immunotherapy has gradually become a research hotspot in cancer treatment. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, as a type of immunotherapy drug, have demonstrated promising anti-tumor efficacy and low side effects in clinical trials. Iparomlimab and Tuvonralimab is a novel therapeutic biological product targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4. It is composed of two engineered monoclonal antibodies (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) expressed in a fixed ratio and has shown significant efficacy in cervical cancer patients. Therefore, given the urgent need to improve neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced cervical cancer and fertility-preserving neoadjuvant therapy for early-stage cervical cancer patients, this study is being conducted to explore and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Iparomlimab and Tuvonralimab combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin as neoadjuvant therapy for cervical cancer.

Minimally invasive, or laparoscopic, surgery is a type of surgery where only small incisions are made on the abdomen and surgical instruments are placed through these incisions to perform the surgery. This type of surgery has been shown to improve outcomes in many types of surgery, including in gynecologic cancer surgery. Specifically, researchers know that patients who have minimally invasive surgery have less pain after surgery, can go home quicker from the hospital, healing time is more rapid, and potentially this can translate into returning to chemotherapy sooner. Specifically, in ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer, minimally invasive surgery has not been used as much because these cancers can have tumors all throughout the inside of the abdomen (i.e. wide tumor burden) and located in areas that are sometimes not easily reachable with laparoscopic instruments. However, the reason patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy is to shrink the tumor/s to make the surgery less extensive and the recovery easier.

NCT06772363,SERS-Based Serum Molecular Spectral Screening for Hematogenous Metastasis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06772363,,"Although modern medicine has made significant progress in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, most patients are diagnosed at locally advanced stage or with distant metastases, especially in the late stages where the cancer has spread to other organs through hematogenous metastasis. This not only significantly the survival rate of patients but also increases the complexity and difficulty of treatment. Hematogenous metastasis plays an important role in the clinical progression of lung cancer, its complex biological processes pose a huge challenge for clinical management. Early detection of hematogenous metastasis is difficult, and traditional imaging methods have limited sensitivity in detecting small metastatic lesions. The emerging technology of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has been limited in clinical application due to its high detection costs and technical requirements. Therefore researching and developing high-sensitivity, high-specificity, simple, easy-to-popularize, and low-cost technologies to predict the risk of hematogenous metastasis lung cancer is crucial for early diagnosis and more precise treatment. Raman spectroscopy (RS), a non-invasive and highly specific molecular detection technology, can detect in biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and sugars related to tumor metabolism in biological samples at the molecular level. Surface-enhanced R spectroscopy (SERS), developed based on this technology, is one of the feasible methods for high-sensitivity biomolecular analysis. Although SERS technology has shown diagnostic results in numerous preclinical studies of various tumors, it is limited by small sample sizes and lacks external validation. Therefore, clinical studies on the diagnosis of tumors Raman spectroscopy are needed, with the following requirements: 1. Objective, rapid, and practical Raman spectroscopy data processing methods are needed, and and deep learning methods may be the best classification methods; 2. Multicenter, large-sample clinical samples are needed to train deep learning diagnostic models, and real-world performance should be validated through external data from prospective studies. In previous study, the investigators collected serum Raman spectroscopy data from a cohort of 23 patients with lung malignancies and developed an intelligent Raman diagnostic system for hematogenous metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on learning models, with an accuracy rate of 95%.

NCT06317389,PACOME (PAtient Cancer Oral MEdication) Cohort of Patients Treated with Oral Anticancer Drugs Benefiting from Oncoral Multidisciplinary Monitoring in Real Life: Predictive Factors and Safety of Treatments,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06317389,PACOME,"With the shift to ambulatory care and the rise of ATCO oral anticancer drugs, a growing number of cancer patients are benefiting from oral treatment in an outpatient setting, which meets their needs and preference over injectable chemotherapy with more autonomy and less time spent in the hospital. However, outside the safe hospital context, the complex pharmacological profile of ATCO exposes patients to iatrogenic drug risks. These medicinal problems or Drug Related Problems DRP linked to ATCO are sources of dosage modifications and lead to sub-therapeutic doses compared to clinical trials and consequently to a reduction, in life actual, dose-intensity and expected response. Furthermore, insufficiently controlled in an ambulatory environment and due to a lack of city-hospital coordination, DRPs lead to an increase in the consumption of care.

Oncoral is the pioneering multidisciplinary city-hospital monitoring of outpatients treated with oral anticancer drugs. Set up in 2014 by the Hospices Civils de Lyon, this educational monitoring is based on a tripartite hospital intervention (oncologist, pharmacist, nurse) and a structured city-hospital link with private health professionals (attending doctor, community pharmacist and freelance nurse). Multidisciplinary interventions are focused on PROs and DRPs and combine an educational approach for the patient based on their needs and potential social vulnerabilities.

The PACOME real-life database will describe the population of ambulatory patients treated by ATCO benefiting from the secure multidisciplinary city-hospital Oncoral pathway with the aim of improving knowledge on this population, on the real-life use of ATCO and on new methods of organizing ambulatory cancer care.

The PACOME database collects sociodemographic, clinical and therapeutic data, and experiences in this population. Patients quality of life and other PROs (symptoms and adverse effects experienced by patients), social determinants, health care consumption, the caregiver-patient relationship, the use of digital technology in health, the organization of care, the city-hospital link (interventions of actors and their temporality).

This base will make it possible to optimize the treatment of patients at the individual and population level and to generate evidence in addition to clinical trials, which are expected by health professionals and decision-makers. With patient data from the secure Oncoral pathway, PACOME brings together the three major and inseparable assets of real-life databases: quality, completeness and meaning of the data.

NCT06193083,DEprescribing: Perceptions of PAtients Living With Advanced Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06193083,DEPAL,"Polymedication in palliative oncology care is a real public health problem. This phenomenon has been shown to increase the risk of iatrogenesis, reduce patients' quality of life and increase healthcare costs. For many years, health policies have been developed in geriatrics to reduce polymedication through deprescription tools.

Recently, palliative care initiatives have been introduced, but without having studied the potential specificities of this population (younger, with a different care dynamic and life trajectory). It is important to better understand this population's perceptions of deprescribing in order to adapt tools/actions to make these approaches more efficient.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate patients' perceptions of deprescribing in palliative cancer care, and the secondary aim is to investigate factors that may influence patients' attitudes and beliefs about deprescribing. At the same time, we will study the psychometric properties of the rPATD (Revised Patients' Attitudes Towards Deprescribing) in this population (a standardized questionnaire validated in geriatric medicine to assess patients' perceptions of deprescription).An ancillary study will be carried out to investigate the link between patients' health literacy and their perception of deprescribing (health literacy is defined as the ability to acquire, understand and use information in ways that promote and maintain good health).

To meet our objectives, we will conduct a 3-year national, prospective, observational, multicenter study with an exploratory sequential mixed design. The study will comprise an initial qualitative phase. Semi-directed individual interviews using a descriptive approach will be carried out (around 25 patients, over an 8-month period). Following analysis of the qualitative data, we will then carry out a quantitative study to determine the distribution of the different profiles within this population and the factors influencing the perception of deprescription. The self-administered questionnaires, rPATD and BMQ (medication beliefs questionnaire), potentially supplemented by other items following analysis of the qualitative data, will be administered to 300 patients (over a 12-month period).The ancillary study will be carried out during this second phase, using a validated self-questionnaire to assess patients' level of literacy.

In this context, the aim is to analyse a specific type of adult germinal testicular cancers, seminomas. Directly related to our research interest, the histological, transcriptomic and epigenetic features of theses adult tumours are reminiscent of germinal cells normally present in foetuses. The investigator postulates that these similarities could also extend to the biology of transposable elements (TE), and in particular to the initiation of the control of these elements.

PSMA is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in the majority of prostate cancers. PSMA imaging utilizes this overexpression, by binding on the transmembrane receptor and internalization in the cancer cells. The internalized isotope can then be imaged with the use of a PET/CT or PET/MRI scanner and show where cancer cells may be present in the body. This imaging modality has been shown to be superior to conventional imaging, such as bone scan and CT, in the detection of prostate cancer tumors.

It is the goal of these studies to supply the specificities and affinities to patient T cells without regard for their ""endogenous"" T cell receptor repertoire, directed by antibody-defined recognition to kill malignant cells based on their expression of antigen. We will achieve this by preparing chimeric IgCD28TCR genes in mammalian expression vectors to yield ""designer T cells"" from normal patient cells. This extends the approach of Anderson, Rosenberg and co-workers to introduce or augment expression of genes in patients' T cells in a therapeutic setting.

Prior studies in model systems demonstrated that recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modified T cells to respond to antigen targets with IL2 secretion, cellular proliferation, and cytotoxicity, the hallmarks of an effective, self-sustaining immune response. It therefore becomes of paramount interest to extend these studies to a human system of widespread clinical relevance to explore the clinical potential of this new technology.

NCT01830504,A Multicenter Phase II Pilot Open Label,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01830504,BKM120,"In France, 7-8 000 new thyroid cancer cases are diagnosed each year. Although a good overall prognosis, it is usually estimated that 10 to 20% will rescue and 5% will become metastatic.

The standard treatment of advanced metastatic or recurrent thyroid cancer is limited to radioiodine therapy. It is estimated that 30 to 50% of patients will become resistant to radio iodine. Treatments options are limited in these refractory thyroid patients and long term survival is estimated to less than 10%. Nowadays, no drug is approved in this indication.

The recent explosion in knowledge in tumour biology and the identification of potential biological targets in thyroid cancer led to several clinical trials with targeted therapies, mainly focused on TKI inhibitors targeting the MAPkinase pathway and/or VEGF. Preliminary results were encouraging in papillary thyroid tumors.

Follicular (FTC) and poorly differentiated thyroid (PDTC) cancers account for 10% of thyroid cancer but 20-25% of cancers diagnosed at an advanced stage and near 50% of metastatic refractory thyroid cancers. These cancers with an aggressive behavior represent a major cause of death from thyroid cancer. In these subtypes, targeted therapies gave disappointing results. This may be related to the mutational profile of these tumors which is different from that of papillary cancers. Aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is thought to play a fundamental role in thyroid tumorigenenesis of follicular and poorly differentiated thyroid cancers. Many genetic alterations have been, recently, identified in this pathway. PIK3CA mutations are found in 10-15% of FTC and can also occur in metastases derived from PDTC. Amplification/genomic copy gain of the PIK3CA has been identified in 24% of FTC and 42% of PDTC. Epigenetic inactivation of PTEN which negatively regulates PI3K has been shown in FTC. Moreover, RAS mutations observed in 20-40% of FTC and PDTC can activate the PI3K/AKT by interacting with the RAS-binding site of the P110 catalytic subunit of PI3K.

Due to the high frequency of activation of PI3K and downstream effectors in progressive, recurrent and poorly differentiated cancers, inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway with BKM120, a potent pan class I PI3K inhibitor, represents a particularly relevant therapeutic target and should be properly evaluated in advanced follicular and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas",NO,Thyroid Cancers,DRUG: BKM120,"progression-free survival (PFS), The progression-free survival is defined as a lack of objective tumor progression and death.

This group-based intervention combines sleep restriction and stimulus control with mindfulness principles and exercises to reduce worry and promote positive responses to insomnia.

First, because hematologic cancer patients are immunosuppressed, MBTI needs to be adapted for one-to-one delivery. Second, because hematologic cancer patients experience significant daytime fatigue, pain, and distress, MBTI needs to be adapted to include systematic training in coping skills for these symptoms. The investigators propose to develop and pilot test an adapted MBTI (MBTI+) protocol for hematologic cancer patients reporting insomnia, fatigue, pain, and/or distress after inpatient chemotherapy. The study will be conducted in two phases. In Phase I, the study team will use focus groups with hematologic cancer patients and hematology-oncology providers to guide development along with user testing with hematologic cancer patients reporting insomnia and daytime symptoms of fatigue, pain, and/or distress. Phase II will involve a small single-arm pilot to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and examine pre- to post-intervention primary (insomnia) and secondary (fatigue, pain, distress, mindfulness, self-efficacy) outcomes of the MBTI+ protocol. MBTI+ will consist of six, 60- to 75-minute therapy sessions delivered either in-person or via videoconferencing technology. Study measures will be collected at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention.",YES,Hematologic Malignancy,BEHAVIORAL: Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia with Cognitive-Behavioral Symptom Coping Skills,"Feasibility as Measured by Number of Participants Accrued to Single-arm Pilot, Treatment feasibility will be indicated by meeting target study accrual (i.e., 30 participants consented and enrolled for single-arm pilot)., 12 weeks (post-intervention)|Feasibility as Measured by Study Attrition at Post-intervention Follow-up, Treatment feasibility will be indicated by less than or equal to 20% study attrition at post-intervention follow-up., 12 weeks (post-intervention)|Feasibility as Measured by Adherence to the Intervention, Adherence will be indicated by at least 80% of the participants completing all 6 intervention sessions., 12 weeks (post-intervention)|Acceptability as Measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ), Acceptability will be indicated by at least 80% of participants who completed the intervention protocol reporting satisfaction with the protocol on the CSQ (i.e., mean of at least 3 out of 4).

NCT04816656,An Integrated Digital PROM-platform for Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04816656,COVID-ONCO,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cancer are subject to multiple risks (e.g. frequent hospital visits, increased infection risk, more severe clinical course, discontinued cancer treatment etc.).

Patients undergoing cancer therapy are also faced with several Quality of Life - impairing side effects. In the case of a positive COVID-19 cancer patient, the need and intensity of treating must be weighed against the possible higher risk of developing severe complications in the course of a COVID-19 infection. Nevertheless, both for COVID-19 positive and negative patients who will continue or discontinue cancer treatment throughout the pandemic, providing supportive care is more important than ever.

Digitally monitoring patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) could offer a solution to improve the supportive care measures during cancer treatment, and certainly in times of COVID-19. Digitalized PROMS could significantly contribute to improved communication, patient satisfaction, supportive care, monitoring of cancer treatment, and detection of problems.

To date, clinical trials investigating the benefits of digital PROMS in patients with cancer during the current COVID-19 pandemic are lacking.

At the Jessa Hospital, the investigators already have experience in collecting PROMs via a digital platform (Awell Health) since 2019 for patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy using validated QoL questionnaires.

The overall aim of this project is to prospectively evaluate the impact of a COVID-19 infection on the severity of the cancer therapy-related complications and the QoL of patients with cancer

Until the 2018 recommendations of the 6th European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL6), primary prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (IFI), in allograft patients, was based on the administration of fluconazole until D100. Due to changes in transplantation practices (alternative donor transplantation, sequential transplantation, etc.) and changes in microbiological ecology (increased incidence of IFIs caused by filamentous germs such as aspergillosis and mycormycosis), fluconazole prophylaxis is now sometimes suboptimal. It is therefore recommended that patients at high risk of developing IFIs should be given azole molecules with activity against filamentous agents as primary prophylaxis during the first 3 months after transplantation.

Posaconazole is often under-dosed (below the minimum effective concentration).

NCT05807789,Molecular-genetic Characterization in Patients Undergoing CAR-T Cell Infusion,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05807789,CAR_22,"In recent years, the application of increasingly advanced methods of ex-vivo cell culture and cell engineering has made it possible to develop new cellular therapeutic platforms including the ""CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) - T cell therapy"". CAR-T cell therapy is a therapy that uses T lymphocytes engineered to express a chimeric receptor directed against a specific antigen, theoretically applicable to the treatment of all neoplasms but currently more widely used in the treatment of haematological malignancies. One of the most innovative aspects introduced with CAR-T cell therapy is that of living-drug, cells that act as a drug as well as a means to build specific immunity against the neoplasm. The advantages of this therapy are therefore represented by the possibility of refueling the patient's immunity, deficient in the control of the neoplastic disease, with lymphocytes capable of expressing an antineoplastic activity with mechanisms not subject to restriction of HLA-mediated antigen recognition.

However, the use of CAR-T therapies is not free from potentially serious and sometimes lethal adverse events; in the toxicity profile the following are recognizable as peculiar:

* cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
* B-cell aplasia (hypogammaglobulinemia)
* neurological adverse reactions
* haematological toxicity
* infections. Therefore, considering that on the one hand adverse events are not negligible and on the other hand that a percentage \> 50% of patients lose the response obtained, it is necessary to improve the therapeutic profile of CAR-T cell therapy by increasing its efficacy and reducing its toxicity .
